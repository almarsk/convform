CSO.prompt will be used in various situations

ResponseStates::new() if empty response states (can be achieved with higher noninitiativeness
prompt - this is whats up, make answer

assess_response_states - handle_noninitiative branch -
prompt - is this a good answer?, maybe it should be changed completely

in rust - when i want (mainly if empty for now) put a prompt in cso prompt
prompt will be a measure of how much things can change
and maybe there should be a switch for the 613 shenanigans
prompt should be assembled with respect to things we know - initiativity + what else?

in reply()
in python - if prompt non empty - run over the whole thing
in python - use 613 to add intents possibly
(TODO keeping state, especially for empty)

play around with fill_in() order
task fill_in() maybe shouldnt have history
only global fill_in() should maybe have history
