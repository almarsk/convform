Rating deep 2.5344827586206895
Rating nass 2.9523809523809526

Surprisingly shallow anaphora has worse score than deep anaphora.

Kruskal-Wallis Test p-value: 0.020462703785719412
Effect Size (Eta Squared): 0.029688178453053583
Comparison: deep vs nonassignable, p-value: 0.0048713423950883464
Comparison: deep vs shallow, p-value: 0.1582978409422613
Comparison: nonassignable vs shallow, p-value: 0.136917898603309

Only significant for deep vs nonassignable.

Some conversations do not have a rating (participant clicked off of the experiment webpage)
These conversations can be interpreted as worse possible reaction - 5.

We can further split these into a situation where the participant clicked off of the experiment
right after the stimulus - this only happened in case of nonassignable anaphora design.

Ratio stimulus null rating shallow:deep:nonassignable 2:6:11
Rating incl null direct shlw 2.7549019607843137
Rating incl null direct deep 2.5344827586206895
Rating incl null direct nass 3.063063063063063

Rating diff nonull vs null direct shlw 0.0
Rating diff nonull vs null direct deep 0.0
Rating diff nonull vs null direct nass -0.11068211068211031

Or we can interpret as worse rating if participant clicked off at any time:

Rating incl null anytime shlw 2.798076923076923
Rating incl null anytime deep 2.765625
Rating incl null anytime nass 3.146551724137931

Rating diff nonull vs null anytime shlw -0.0431749622926092
Rating diff nonull vs null anytime deep -0.2311422413793105
Rating diff nonull vs null anytime nass -0.1941707717569785

The difference shows that the shallow anaphora had by far the least people just leaving.

Kruskal-Wallis Test p-value: 0.017698134990819445
Effect Size (Eta Squared): 0.02871385062422946
Comparison: deep vs nonassignable, p-value: 0.01597013599420015
Comparison: deep vs shallow, p-value: 0.652654604765214
Comparison: nonassignable vs shallow, p-value: 0.018874560457834404

Here the results are more significant but still not for deep vs shallow.
There are many factors in the conversation data and
stimulus does not seem to have a strong enough effect on the rating.
If better more seamless conversation could be simulated,
perhaps stronger effect of the stimulus on rating could be observed.
The small difference can also be attributed to the fact that participants tend to
avoid extremes in their grading.

Zero anaphora
______________
Number of zero anaphora conversations: 16
stimulus zero anaphora shallow:deep:nonassignable 08:08:00
Rating zero anaphora continuation:meta:abort 14:02:00

Rating zero anaphora 2.1875
Rating non zero anaphora 2.7291666666666665

Zero anaphora seems has much better scores.
Anaphorization has to incorporate zero anaphore better in the future.

Kruskal-Wallis Test p-value: 0.10266771117843472
Effect Size (Eta Squared): 0.009445412958117978

Very small effect.
To find statistically significant effect on conversation styles
the conversation needs to be controlled in a more nuanced way by the dialog system.
