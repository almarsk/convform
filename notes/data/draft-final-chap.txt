            Surprisingly shallow anaphora has worse score than deep anaphora.

            Comparison: nonassignable vs shallow, p-value: 0.136917898603309

            Only significant for deep vs nonassignable.

            Some conversations do not have a rating (participant clicked off of the experiment webpage)
            These conversations can be interpreted as worse possible reaction - 5.

            We can further split these into a situation where the participant clicked off of the experiment
            right after the stimulus - this only happened in case of nonassignable anaphora design.

            Ratio stimulus null rating shallow:deep:nonassignable 2:6:11

            Rating diff nonull vs null direct nass -0.11068211068211031

            Or we can interpret as worse rating if participant clicked off at any time:

            Rating incl null anytime shlw 2.798076923076923
            Rating incl null anytime deep 2.765625
            Rating incl null anytime nass 3.146551724137931

            Rating diff nonull vs null anytime shlw -0.0431749622926092
            Rating diff nonull vs null anytime deep -0.2311422413793105
            Rating diff nonull vs null anytime nass -0.1941707717569785

            The difference shows that the shallow anaphora had by far the least people just leaving.

            Kruskal-Wallis Test p-value: 0.017698134990819445
            Effect Size (Eta Squared): 0.02871385062422946
            Comparison: deep vs nonassignable, p-value: 0.01597013599420015
            Comparison: deep vs shallow, p-value: 0.652654604765214
            Comparison: nonassignable vs shallow, p-value: 0.018874560457834404

            Here the results are more significant but still not for deep vs shallow.
            There are many factors in the conversation data and
            stimulus does not seem to have a strong enough effect on the rating.
            If better more seamless conversation could be simulated,
            perhaps stronger effect of the stimulus on rating could be observed.
            The small difference can also be attributed to the fact that participants tend to
            avoid extremes in their grading.

            Very small effect.
            To find statistically significant effect on conversation styles
            the conversation needs to be controlled in a more nuanced way by the dialog system.

            relaxed style is often reduced to repetition

            Zero anaphora seems has much better scores.
            Anaphorization has to incorporate zero anaphore better in the future.

            243 misunderstood reference
            limiting context for deep anaphore can lead to anaphore being open to a remap
        - Indirect anaphora (Pseudoanaphora)
            hardcoded phrase with intended nonassignable anaphore is sometimes assignable by association

        - Inappropriate pragmatics
            127, 145 repeating a question - topical/pragmatic incoherence
                limiting context for deep anaphore tends to generate inappropriate pragmatics

        - Sequential coherence
            123 sequentially interesting

            312 vague anaphore, but on topic

        - Returning to entities that havent been topicalized
            162 graph according to Daneš

            b: Jaký je T1?

            entity of q anaphore returned to is not topicalized at any point
            as opposed to 145 where entity of q anaphore is topicalized
        ...

        - Generation issues
        word order is sometimes weirdly generated due to anaphorization
        it is contrastive so not ungrammatical, only pragmatics is off (33)

        deep anaphora design has multiple scenarios it tends to go in:
            deep with generation issue
            deep with acceptance
            deep within same topic, other within same topic
        deep anaphora acceptance depends on
            whether the topic shift is annotated, accepted and
            whether there is enough information to perform mapping

        nonassignable
            appropriate verb wouldve changed the data
                on purpose - hardcoded
            156 !!
            its not easy changing just the anaphore

        - Chaos
            323, 319p pure chaos
            248, 260 between shallow deep and nonassignable
