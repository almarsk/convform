COHERENCE DISRUPTIONS IN HUMAN-CHATBOT INTERACTION: TOWARDS QUANTITATIVE APPROACH TO CONVERSATION
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

INTRO 2
Recently, there has been a breakthrough in the way we interact with machines.
We can now instruct a computer using natural language, the human speech.
This opens new possibilities.
Besides making existing technology an extra step accessible,
new ways to use technology come up.
Automated interaction alone can solve previously unsolvable problems,
such as notably accessing a knowledge base.
Until recently a knowledge base would usually be accessed only via fulltext,
meaning we would only be able to find
information of which knew part of the formal encoding.
Today, we can search for information simply asking questions,
all thanks to natural language computer interface.

The promise of much practical usage of the current wave of generative AI is ambitious
and only brings its fruit slowly, perhaps slower, than was expected.
There is talk of a "plateau" in development of the technology powering the current cutting edge inventions.
And that is not the only issue there is to the current wave of cutting edge AI.
    The electricity consumption is high and
    the societal impact is unpredictable and broad
to name the most prominent ones.

That being said, in context of conversation research,
this tool awakens temptation and curiosity.
With a partial control of what happens in the conversation and a decent certainty, that
our system will simulate actual human-human conversation in its coherence, it begs a question,
whether we could elicitate conversational data -
transcripts (or logs) of the human-bot interaction, that could be categorized based on
    which researcher controlled stimulus and
    which participant reaction to given stimulus
they contain.

In the 1960s the relatively recent emergence and adoption of telephone technology
allowed for recording and transcribing the most authentic conversational data to date.
This advancement took place thanks to developement in technology.
This is reminiscent of the current day situation.

While human-bot conversational data is arguably less authentic,
experimental approach can be taken with the human element remaining present.
And so the current wave of development in AI
moves us a leap forward in understanding what conversation is -
for the first time in history, we have a talking machine
and better yet, it obeys our commands.

This papers task is two-fold.
Firstly it seeks to provide a debate on a metaresearch question -
is using generative AI a viable methodology for conversation research?
This is done by attempting to develop that very methodology.
Proceeding we operate in a frontier,
the first steps should be establishing data backed baseline knowledge
and assessing possible lines of research.

One way to understand what makes the unraveling text of a conversation
a valid one - a coherent one,
is obtaining conversational data containing coherence disruptions.
This can be done using the discussed technology -
it has the capability of conversing in a way
that is found generally acceptable by humans
and can drift away from the coherent interaction
if correctly instruced to do so.

Instead of reconstructing what conversation is bottom to top,
the data this paper seeks to elicitate and analyse are
regular conversation data containing moments which
have the potential to be problematic for
the human participant to process and follow up on.
The line between what a coherent and an incoherent conversation is blurred.
It is in no way a binary property of the conversation.
This approach can however point at the divide between them.

While chatbots are evaluated for how natural and error free their way of conversating is,
humans in their conversation frequently
    make errors and
    temporarily disrupt conversational coherence
in the case of human-human communication, these disruptions can be cured easily.

It used to be that in human-bot communication, disruptions could derail a conversation completely,
leaving the bot, who would only rely on surface level clues, in the dark.
This has become rare with generative AI.
The cutting edge technology powered chatbots are
    better capable of understanding and producing relevant answers
    behind the scene instructed so that they return to their point of departure
        (offering help and service)
making the default generative AI chatbot a very broad single-purpose one.
Human-bot communication is often single-purpose - there is a goal to be achieved.
The coherence of such conversation can then be described based on whether
the goal has been achieved with success.
An open-domain (also called chit-chat or smalltalk) human-bot conversation is possible.
Some factors related to coherence in open-domain conversation
(whether it is human-human or human-bot) stem from
    convention and politeness   (Brown, Levinson)
    communication strategy      (Austin, Searl)
    conversational maxims       (Grice)
    sequence structure          (Schegloff, Sacks)
    message and topic           (???)
While all of the mentioned areas bring a lot to the table,
rarely do they concern themselves with the textual dimension of conversation.
Most of the mentioned authors works do not fit in the field of linguistics, they only inform it.
Exceptions from this trend have emerged.
Interaction linguistics branches out of conversation analysis and
points out specifically linguistic aspects in interaction to name a good example.

Now that the natural language interface for communication with computers has been established
it is possible to participate in cocreation of the conversation data text
bringing us one step closer to experimental conversation research.


THEORY 15
Hrbáček, Halliday, Smith, Givón, Nedoluzhko, Izotopie (Daneš a další)

Text
In order to operate on a firm base, we need to equip ourselves with some theory.
The following concepts need to be explained on their own terms and in relation to each other:
Text, coherence, cohesion, anaphore, cataphore, endophore, exophore, topic, entity and association.

    Text
    linguistic, written - intentional, juxtaposed, coherent, spatial
    spoken - multiproducer, negotiated, temporal

    This is as far as we need to go to suffice the topic of this paper,
    but it is worth noting that the notion of text can go way further,
    if we take semiotics and poststructuralism in the picture.

    Coherence
    what makes text understandable.
    property of text as a whole
    cognitive
        - whether a written text is coherent depends mostly on the reader
        - whether a spoken text is coherent depends on an ongoing negotiation
    examples

    Cohesion
    cohesion is not a property of text or anything else
    umbrella concept covering specific relations within the structure of the text
    cohesive text does not need to be coherent
    examples (Hrbáček)

    Anaphore and Endophore
    a reference inside the text pointing back
    typically demonstratives or gendered flective endings
    a cohesive element
    anaphore referent can be subject to negotiation in conversation

    Cataphore and Exophore - a thin line
    a reference pointing towards in text
    unimportant for conversation
        understanding is achieved through trust and compliance with promise
        demonstrative lacking referent can point forward in text,
        but can simply be understood via shared knowledge of speakers
        making it an exophore
        difference here is formal and unimportant
        as given referent is activated in speakers minds
    referent of a cataphore is a realized potential of an exophore
    only the referent is a cohesive element

    Topic
    content of text, what is it about
    difficult to delimit
    topic development within text is realized via anaphore and association
    the topic composition of text contributes to text coherence

    Association
    textual realization of an isotopic relation
    cohesive element, difficult to formalize

    Entity
    for the purpose of this paper, another concept is added - an entity
    entity somewhat overlaps with topic,
    but a single topic can contain several entities within a text
    entity is typically a noun in text,
    which can be meaningfully reffered to by an anaphore
    or can realize an exophore potential making it a cataphore
    has cohesive potential

Conversation
To define conversation in terms of previously introduced concepts,
one could see conversation as text which is produced by multiple producers
This complicates things
    conversation happens as opposed to text which is made
    conversational content is constantly negotiated by participants
    temporal and cooperative nature of conversation allows
        overlaps
        swiftly corrected errors
        there is multiple perspectives
            each particiapnts perspective
            each idea of all the other participants perspectives
            each participants idea of the conversation text that is being cocreated
        all of these can fall out of sync creating misunderstandings
        humans however are pretty good at correcting misunderstandings
        this is because under regular circumstances, people cooperate
grice cooperation principle and maxims

conversation as such has long been considered chaotic
the origin of modern conversation research is conversation analysis
thanks to recordings of phonecalls, transcripts could be qualitatively analyzed
    adjacency pair
    prefered answers
    topic shading
    sequence structure
this analysis has been practiced by sociologists, ethnometodologists
in modern day, there is a conversation analysis descendant called
interaction linguistics - topic and sequence

Disruptions
While the question of what makes for a coherent text is very broad,
to ask and answer what makes for a coherent conversation seems comfortably in reach
since conversation participants negotiate understanding,
it is up to them, when a conversation is and is not coherent
to describe a coherent what a functioning conversation is,
it is worth pursuing the moments, when the conversation stops working,
we could call those coherence disruptions
a coherence disruption is a complex phenomena,
    it penetrates through some or all of mentioned perspectives on an on-going conversation
    it can't be evaluate in a binary fashion
        there are different degrees to which a conversation coherence can be disrupted
if a participant suddenly starts speaking in an uncoherent way on their own,
if the utterance simply is not grammatical and or understandable,
while the conversation has been compromised and becomes incoherent,
it has more to do with incoherent written text, because
only one speaker is at the source of the incoherence
- Smith
it is a considerably different phenomena from when
the source of incoherence stems from
    the structure of the conversational text or
    relationship between different utterances

which incoherence sources are there for conversation?
schegloff - sequence structure
hrbáček - topic progression (issuez)
    topic shifts
    		-> abrupt topic shifts
			 -> when is a topic exhausted?
			 -> what makes for a good segway?
unassignable anaphore
			-> it is to be negotiated what is the topic
			-> meaning of demonstratives is to be negotiated
			-> types of confusing assignability
				-> no candidates
					-> can be understood as a promis of a cataphore/exophorically
				-> multiple candidates
				-> candidate too long ago
					-> can be understood as an abrupt return to previously established topic
so what do participants do about it?
schegloff again
dingemans
    metacommunication, interactive repair
    inference, pragmatic reasoning

Conclusion
    unassignable anaphore is underresearched
    and a perfect area to work on our metaresearch question

		hardcoded phrase with intended unassignable anaphore is sometimes assignable by association
		limiting context for deep anaphore tends to generate inappropriate pragmatics
		limiting context for deep anaphore can lead to anaphore being open to a remap
		inquisitivity sometimes appreciated, other times considered lack of contribution
		deep anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as an abrupt shift to previous topic
		unassignable anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as a cataphore
		        cataphore is unimportant in conversation, it is a text phenomena
			    what is important is there is trust (or tolerance)
