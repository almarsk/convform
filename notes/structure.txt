COHERENCE DISRUPTIONS IN HUMAN-CHATBOT INTERACTION: TOWARDS QUANTITATIVE APPROACH TO CONVERSATION
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

INTRODUCTION
Recently, there has been a breakthrough in the way we interact with machines.
We can now instruct a computer using natural language, the human speech.
This opens new possibilities.
Besides making existing technology an extra step accessible,
new ways to use technology come up.
Automated interaction alone can solve previously unsolvable problems,
such as notably accessing a knowledge base.
Until recently a knowledge base would usually be accessed only via fulltext,
meaning we would only be able to find
information of which we knew a part of the formal encoding.
Today, we can search for information simply by asking questions,
all thanks to natural language computer interface.

The promise of much practical usage of the current wave of generative AI is ambitious
and only brings its fruit slowly, perhaps slower, than was expected.
There is talk of a "plateau" in development of the technology powering the current cutting edge inventions.
And that is not the only issue there is to the current wave of cutting edge AI.
    The electricity consumption is high and
    the societal impact is unpredictable and broad
to name the most prominent ones.

That being said, in context of conversation research,
this development in technology promises to open many new doors.
With a partial control of what happens in the conversation and a decent certainty, that
our system will simulate human-human conversation to the user,
new kind of conversational data is in reach -
logs of the human-bot interaction, that could be categorized based on
    which researcher controlled stimulus and
    which participant reaction to given stimulus
they contain.

In the 1960s the relatively recent emergence and adoption of telephone technology
allowed for recording and transcribing the most authentic conversational data to date.
This advancement took place thanks to developement in technology.
This is reminiscent of the current day situation.
While human-bot conversational data is arguably less authentic than telephone conversation transcripts,
experimental approach can be taken with the human element remaining present.

This papers intention is two-fold.
Firstly it seeks to provide a debate on a metaresearch question -
is using generative AI a viable methodology for conversation research?
This is done by attempting to develop that very methodology.
Proceeding we operate in a frontier,
our first steps should be establishing data backed baseline knowledge
and assessing possible lines of research.

One way to understand what makes the unraveling text of a conversation
a valid one - a coherent one -
is obtaining conversational data containing coherence disruptions.
This can be done using the discussed technology -
it has the capability of conversing in a way
that is found generally acceptable by humans
and can drift away from the coherent interaction
if correctly instruced to do so.

The data this paper seeks to elicitate and analyse are
actual exchanges containing moments which
have the potential to be problematic for
the human participant to process and follow up on.
The line between what a coherent and an incoherent conversation is blurred.
It is in no way a binary property of the text of the conversation.
This approach has the potential however point out the gradual divide between them.

While chatbots are evaluated for how natural and error free their way of conversing is,
humans in their conversation frequently
    make errors and
    temporarily disrupt conversational coherence
in the case of human-human communication, these disruptions can be cured easily.

It used to be (and remains so in legacy systems)
that in human-bot communication, disruptions could derail a conversation completely,
leaving the bot, who would only rely on surface level clues, in the dark.
This has become rare with generative AI. (Though it brings a set of its own problems.)
The cutting edge technology powered chatbots are
    better capable of understanding and producing relevant answers
    behind the scenes instructed so that
        they return to their conversational point of departure -
            offering help and service.

Nowadays in practice, human-bot communication is often single-purpose.
Companies deploy voice applications to interact with customers,
so there is usually a goal to be achieved.
The coherence of such conversation can then be described based on whether
the goal has been achieved with success and ease.
Another common scenario is a purpose-less conversation. It gets called chit-chat or smalltalk.
It can be described as open-domain.
An open-domain human-bot conversation is possible
though less common.

Some factors that influence coherence in conversational texts,
whether in human-human or human-bot exchanges,
have been extensively studied.

---
Namely
 **Politeness**
Brown and Levinson’s work on politeness strategies highlights the role of socially aligned communication in smooth interactions. Politeness strategies, such as using polite language, offering options, or softening potentially face-threatening comments, help to create a comfortable communicative environment. These strategies align with social norms, which people interpret as markers of respect, consideration, or even trust. However, a failure to employ these politeness strategies, or using them inconsistently, can disrupt conversational coherence. For example, blunt or overly direct responses may be perceived as abrupt or rude, diverting the conversation's flow or causing discomfort. In such cases, the breakdown of polite norms can lead participants to question intent, hindering effective and smooth communication.

**Communication Strategy**
Building on Austin and Searle's speech act theories, communication strategies rely on expressing clear intentions and meanings that foster mutual understanding. When speakers convey intentions explicitly through statements, questions, requests, or assertions, it signals to listeners the purpose and direction of the conversation. Effective communication strategies help maintain coherence by ensuring each contribution builds logically on the last. On the other hand, unclear intentions or ambiguous phrasing can create misunderstandings, disrupting the conversation's flow. Misalignment or mixed signals—such as using sarcasm without cues or making indirect requests without context—can leave listeners uncertain about how to respond, leading to off-track or irrelevant contributions. This weakens the cohesiveness of the interaction and detracts from the shared purpose.

**Conversational Maxims**
Grice’s conversational maxims—Quality, Quantity, Relevance, and Manner—are fundamental to coherent dialogue. They suggest that participants should provide truthful information (Quality), neither too much nor too little (Quantity), remain on-topic (Relevance), and communicate in an orderly, clear manner (Manner). These maxims encourage effective exchange by setting a standard for contributions that are informative, truthful, relevant, and unambiguous. When violated, such as by giving excessive detail, omitting important context, or straying from the topic, coherence suffers. For instance, irrelevant tangents or over-detailed explanations may confuse the listener, diverting attention from the main topic. This misalignment can leave participants uncertain about the conversation’s direction, ultimately diminishing coherence and the effectiveness of communication.

**Sequence Structure**
The work of Schegloff and Sacks on sequence structure and turn-taking emphasizes that ordered interactions support predictability and continuity in dialogue. Turn-taking conventions—where participants follow an implicit sequence of speaking and responding—help maintain the flow by structuring the conversation in a logical order. This sequence structure allows both parties to anticipate when to listen and when to speak, contributing to a well-paced, cohesive exchange. However, interruptions, abrupt changes in topic, or skipping expected responses (e.g., answering a question with a new question) can disrupt this sequence, introducing unpredictability that can confuse participants. These interruptions fragment coherence by shifting the conversation away from expected responses or structured flow, often leaving gaps in understanding or causing conversational breakdowns.

**Message and Topic (Interactional Linguistics)**
Interactional linguistics underscores that consistency in message and topic preserves continuity in conversation. When speakers stick to a shared topic or make gradual, clear shifts, coherence is maintained because participants know what to expect. Frequent or abrupt topic shifts, however, or sending unclear or conflicting messages, can create disjointed exchanges. For instance, introducing a new topic without closure on the previous one can confuse listeners, leading to a scattered or fragmented interaction. By shifting focus unpredictably or offering unclear messages, coherence diminishes as participants lose track of the conversation’s thread, resulting in exchanges that feel scattered or incomplete.

While all of the mentioned areas unveil a lot about the way conversation works,
rarely do they concern themselves with the textual dimension of conversation.
Most of the mentioned authors would hardly be described as linguists,
though their works significantly inform linguistics.
Yet, exceptions from this trend emerge in recent time.
Interaction linguistics branches out of conversation analysis and
points out specifically linguistic aspects in interaction to name a good example.

Opposed to interaction linguistics,
which remains focused on the social and temporal aspect of human-human interaction,
this paper will solely focus on the elements in conversational text,
that make it cohesive and coherent or rather
those that have the potential to prevent it from being those things.
The key concepts discussed in this paper are
coreference realized by anaphore and
closely related - topic; what the text is about.

BACKGROUND
Hrbáček, Halliday, Smith, Givón, Nedoluzhko, Izotopie (Daneš a další)

Textual dimension of conversation
In order to operate on a firm theoretical base, key terminology needs to be established.
The following concepts will be explained on their own terms and in relation to each other:
Text, coherence, cohesion, coreference, anaphore, cataphore, endophore, exophore, topic, entity and association.
The definitions draw from literature but attempt at creating their own sustainable model
without necesarily complying with given literature.

    Text
    Text, in its broadest sense, refers to any form of communication that conveys meaning through a combination of signs, symbols, or language.
    These semiotic structures can take various forms, including written, spoken, visual, or even non-verbal modes of expression.
    A text can be as simple as a single sentence or as complex as a novel, and it can exist across different mediums, from books and articles to advertisements and digital content.
    What defines a text is its ability to convey a coherent message or idea, often intended for interpretation by an audience or an adressee.
    Texts can serve a wide range of purposes, including storytelling, instruction, persuasion, or simply recording information.
    Typically text is a structure that is
    linguistic, produced and percieved as intentional and coherent.
    The text of a conversation is multiproducer.
    This is not the only multiproducer text type out there.
    Another example of a multiproducer text
    would be a sequence of commercial signs on a busy street.
    It is the spatial juxtaposition of the signs and temporal juxtaposition of utterances,
    that make them a text.
    Another property of a conversation text is it is negotiated.
    This is given by its multiproducer and temporal nature.
    Other types of text which are also negotiated are relatively rare.
    There are occurences of debates which take place in written text,
    whether they are press columns or academic articles, which
    interact explicitly with each other, making them a negotiation.
    Such press discourse could however be considered
    a sequence of text units rather than a single temporarily juxtaposed text.
    This perspective could hardly be defended in regards to conversation, because
    its tight temporal coupling and cohesion,
    making conversation a unique phenomena.

    Coherence
    Coherence refers to the logical connections and consistent relationships that
    make a text easy to follow and possible to understand.
    It is achieved when the ideas, sentences, and paragraphs within a text are linked together in a meaningful way,
    allowing the reader to grasp the author's message without confusion.
    Coherence often depends on the use of transitions, the logical flow of arguments, and the proper sequencing of information.
    It ensures that each part of the text contributes to the overall meaning, creating a unified whole.
    Without coherence, a text can be difficult or impossible to understand, even if the individual sentences are grammatically correct.
    It is a property of the whole text, but
    textual elements can be pointed out that contribute to or diminish the given text coherence.
    Those elements are not referred to as "coherence elements";
    will be discussed below.
    Coherence is a cognitive phenomenon because
    it involves the mental processes of interpreting, organizing, and understanding information.
    When reading a text,
    coherence arises not only from the structure and linguistic cues provided by the author but
    also from the reader's ability to
    make connections between ideas based on prior knowledge, expectations, and context.
    This cognitive interaction between the text and the reader’s mind is what makes the content understandable.

    In conversation, coherence becomes even more complex,
    as multiple participants are simultaneously contributing to and interpreting the flow of information.
    Each individual brings their own perspective and understanding to the interaction,
    which requires constant negotiation to maintain coherence.
    Misunderstandings, different backgrounds, and interruptions
    can disrupt the coherence of a conversation,
    making it a more dynamic and fragile process compared to written text.

        - whether a written text is coherent depends mostly on the reader
        - whether a conversation text is coherent depends on an ongoing negotiation

    Coherence is a scalar property rather than a binary one.
    It is however tricky to measure.
    This papers approach is discussed below.
    To summarize,
    different levels of coherence disruptions are declared
    and the acceptance rates in participants are observed
    and corelation between
        those acceptance rates and
        level of coherence disruptions
    are sought for.
    True measuring of coherence is impossible since
    the degree to which a researched text is coherent
    is a part of the research question.
    Acceptance rate as a measurement also has its flaws.
    A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis
        needs to be deployed.

    ---
    Cohesion
    Cohesion and coherence are sometimes used interchangeably.
    However, the two terms hold distinct meanings.
    While coherence refers to the interpretative quality of a text,
    wherein the ideas form a logical and meaningful whole.
    Cohesion, on the other hand, focuses on the structural relations
    within a text, achieved through grammatical and lexical links.
    Hrbáček contends that cohesion is not a property of the text itself.
    Instead, it is an umbrella term
    covering specific relations within
    the structure of the text,
    where cohesive elements can be directly pinpointed.
    While coherent text does not necesarily need to be cohesive,
    cohesive elements often support it.
    A coherent text tends to be at least somewhat cohesive,

    Halliday and Hasan developed
    a detailed framework of cohesion, which includes both
    internal and external referencing mechanisms within a text.
    These include endophoric references, which
    relate parts of the text to each other, and
    exophoric references, which point outside the text.
    Endophoric cohesion covers aspects
    like anaphoric references and cataphoric references.
    Exophoric references, however, rely on shared context beyond the text itself,
    requiring readers to use prior knowledge.
    This cohesive framework highlights how elements of cohesion
    contribute to textual unity and flow, even
    if coherence based on meaning is not fully achieved.
    Following concepts can be considered cohesive elements.

    Anaphore, Endophore and coreference
    A common cohesive text element is an anaphore.
    It is a reference inside the text pointing back to a previously mentioned entity.
    Often it is realised via personal pronouns.
    Though there are other ways for anaphore to realise.
    ---
    In Czech, anaphoric references often rely on grammatical gender and number,
    making participial endings essential for identifying the referent.
    For instance, when a masculine entity is mentioned,
    later references might use a participle in the masculine form, such as šel ("he went"),
    connecting back to muž without repeating the noun.
    Demonstratives, such as ten ("that") or tento ("this one"),
    also frequently serve anaphoric functions, guiding the reader to a previously mentioned subject.
    Temporal and locative adverbs, such as tam ("there") and tehdy ("then"),
    also contribute cohesion by indirectly referencing time and place details introduced earlier in the text.
    These anaphoric elements strengthen textual coherence by reducing redundancy and maintaining flow.
    The reader identifies coreferential links through these markers,
    following the cohesive threads without needing explicit repetitions.

    An anaphoric element is by definition also endophoric (Halliday).
    It points inside the text it appears in.
    By definition an anaphoric element has a referent, which occures earlier in the text.
    These two elements are then coreferent.
    As such they also share an identical exophoric reference (Halliday) - they point outside of the text.

    In conversation, many aspects of which are subject to negotiation,
    also specific coreference relations can be questioned.
    The reference realised by one communication participant may be unclear to the other
    resulting in a repair request.
    In conversation analysis,
    ---
    Sacks’s concept of repair traditionally addresses
    misunderstandings related to intentions and actions,
    drawing on frameworks like Austin’s and Searle’s speech act theories.
    From this perspective, repairs often target interpretative gaps about
    what a speaker intends to do with their utterance.
    However, viewed from a broader, more abstract level,
    repair triggers can extend beyond intentions alone,
    encompassing issues on the textual level as well.
    For instance, an unassignable anaphora —
    a reference that lacks a clear antecedent —
    may lead to a repair request,
    thereby showing how textual ambiguities prompt interactional responses.
    This approach expands the causes of repair in conversation,
    integrating elements of reference (textual level) and interactional misalignment,
    where a structural aspect of the language itself can
    become a repairable issue in the communicative exchange.

    Cataphore and Exophore
    ---
    In Halliday and Hasan's framework,
    cohesion in language is achieved through various devices that connect
    different parts of a text, forming a unified whole.
    Anaphora is central to their concept of cohesive ties,
    as it allows elements in a text to refer back to previously mentioned items,
    creating clear links between ideas and ensuring continuity.
    They classify these cohesive ties as
    references, substitutive forms, ellipsis, and connectors, with
    anaphoric references being one of the primary ways texts achieve cohesion.
    When a text element cannot be mapped to a preceding referent,
    Halliday and Hasan suggest that cohesion is maintained through
    shared situational understanding, making the reference exophoric.
    Cataphoric references, though less common, involve
    elements that look forward in the text,
    showing intentionality by the author but contributing to
    cohesion primarily through the eventual resolution of the forward-pointing referent.

    In covnersation if a seemingly anaphoric text element is not succesfully mapped
    to a preceding textual coreferent
    the reference can still be understood, because shared context.
    Such element reaches out of the text with its reference, making it an exophoric one
    A related phenomena is a cataphore.
    Cataphore is a reference which points forward in the text.
    Such occurence is rare in written text and even more so in a conversation.
    In fact it is somehow pointless to account for cataphore in a multi-producer text.
    A cataphore denotes an authors intention to reveal
    the nature of a referent explicitly after first mentioning them.
    In conversation, where multiple contributors cocreate given text,
    and mutual understanding and agreement is the measure of
    how coherent the produced text is, later realisation of a vague reference
    does not contribute to how coherent it is.
    Regardless, in case of a cataphore, only the referent is a cohesive element,
    not the cataphore,
    as it ties back to the previous text, creating bonds across large textual units.

    Topic
    Topic is what a text is about.
    That makes topic very complicated to pinpoint.
    Among others, some issues with topic and annotating it in text are:
        A text can and typically does contain multiple topics
        Different framing will produce different topic annotations of text
        Topic annotation is by its nature always more text,
            so even it can be annotated for topic.
            making topic annotations recursive.
            One cannot therefore achieve a definite topic description of a text.
        A true strict formal approach to topic does not exist.
        A topic section can be impossible to delimit within text.
    Despite all these complications,
    topic cannot be set aside and ignored in conversation research
    as it is deeply intertwined with already mentioned concepts.
    Topic progressions across text are realised via anaphore and association
    and tightly interact with coherence.
    An appropriate amount of time has to be spend on a given topic unit,
    enough information has to be said about a given topic
    in order for it to be possible to move on or add another one in the conversation.
    A closure has to be provided in order for a topic to be done.
    Transitioning from one topic to another has a potential to disrupt coherence,
    if the association between the topics is too distant.
    A topical divergence has to be justified by a communicational intention.

    Association
    For the purpose of this paper association is textual realization of an isotopic relation. (Koblížek)
    By their exophoric properties, referents exist in a semantic web of relationships.
    Similarly to coherence, associative relationships are a cognitive phenomena.
    They come to exist when they are percieved.
    While association is a cohesive element it is difficult to formalize
    the way it can and has been done with anaphoric text relations.
    It is however a major factor in a coherence of text as
    in extreme cases a text can only rely on association in its coherence.

    Entity
    An entity is an exophoric referent.
    Words or text elements which can be reffered to by an anaphore will be called entities.
    Since a phrase containing an anaphore typically adds more information about the referent
    the new information must be semantically compatible,
    in other words association has to be possible between the referent and the added information.
    Entity also has to do with topic.
    Unfortunately not in a static way however.
    A topic can in text can be represented by a single entity or multiple.
    Coreferent words should be regarded as a single entity.
    It will serve to partially map a topic distance in text (not semantic).
    An extra layer of annotation might be required in some cases,
    but for now entity distance serves as a good enough approach.
    Review of this approach is one of the papers subtasks.
    More on that in the methodology section.

Interactional dimension of conversation
To define conversation in terms of previously introduced concepts,
one could see conversation as text which is produced by multiple producers
This complicates things
    conversation happens as opposed to text which is made
    conversational content is constantly negotiated by participants
    temporal and cooperative nature of conversation allows for
        overlaps
        swiftly corrected errors (a subset of repairs)
        multiple perspectives taking place
            each particiapnts perspective
            each idea of all the other participants perspectives
            each participants idea of the conversation text that is being cocreated
        all of these can desynchronize creating misunderstandings
        humans however are excellent at correcting misunderstandings
        this is because under regular circumstances, people cooperate

The Gricean Cooperation Principle, introduced by philosopher H.P. Grice,
suggests that participants in a conversation typically work together to achieve effective communication.
Grice proposed that, to ensure this cooperation, speakers follow four conversational maxims:
quantity, quality, relation, and manner.

    - Quantity requires speakers to
        provide as much information as needed, but no more.
        Overloading a conversation with excessive details or being too brief could impede clarity.
    - Quality refers to the expectation that
        participants provide truthful information,
        avoiding falsehoods or statements without adequate evidence.
    - Relation (or relevance) ensures that
        contributions to the conversation are pertinent to the ongoing discussion.
    - Manner emphasizes clarity, promoting orderly and unambiguous communication.

These maxims represent an idealized version of conversation
where both parties aim for mutual understanding.
In practice, people may not always follow these maxims
but they do so in ways that still rely on shared expectations of cooperation.
Even when misunderstandings arise,
humans naturally engage in conversational repair,
using their social intuition and mutual cooperativity to clarify intetion and realign perspectives.
Grice's maxims highlight the unspoken rules that underlie smooth conversation,
crucial for maintaining its dynamic, ever-negotiated nature.

Modern conversation research can be understood to reach back to conversation analysis.
---
Conversation analysis has been practiced by sociologists and ethnometodologists.
Modern conversation research traces its roots to conversation analysis,
a field pioneered by sociologists like Harvey Sacks and Emanuel Schegloff.
They sought to understand the structure and
social rules of everyday interactions,
focusing on the patterns and norms that govern turn-taking and response.
For the first time in the 1960's thanks to recordings of phonecalls,
transcripts could be qualitatively analyzed
this research has lead to coining new terminology:
    adjacency pair
    prefered answers
    topic shading
    sequence structure
---
As a descendant of conversation analysis interaction linguistics has emerged,
building on its insights to examine language use in social contexts.
It broadens the focus to study not only verbal exchanges but also
multimodal cues like gestures, gaze, and intonation,
analyzing how these elements contribute to meaning.
Interaction linguistics aims to understand the dynamic aspects of conversations,
such as how topics shift and how sequences of speech acts unfold,
reflecting the fluid nature of human communication.

Disruptions in conversation coherence
While the question of what makes for a coherent text is broad,
to ask and answer what makes for a coherent conversation seems comfortably in reach.
Because conversation participants negotiate understanding,
it is up to them, when a conversation is and is not coherent
to describe what a coherent conversation is,
it is worth pursuing the moments, when the conversation stops working.
Such moments can be called coherence disruptions.
A coherence disruption is a complex phenomena as
    it penetrates through some or all of mentioned perspectives on an on-going conversation
    it can't be evaluated in a binary fashion
there are different degrees to which a conversation coherence can be disrupted
    if a participant suddenly starts speaking
    in an a way that can hardly be considered interaction
    due to its irrelevance or
    if the utterance simply is not grammatical and or understandable,
    while the conversation has been compromised and becomes incoherent,
    it has more to do with incoherent written text, because
    only one speaker is at the source of the incoherence

Smith Discusses various types of incoherent text.
He exemplifies so called giberish as incoherent text that is absent of structural relations.
On the other hand he discusses experimental theater or literature as a type of text
which is assumed to be coherent in the sense that there is an intention behind it
but contains little to no structural relations.
Lastly he mentions a so called "schizophrenic discourse" as a speech that
is not assumed to be coherent even if it has structural relations to it.
This is similar to Hrbáček.
In any case Smith definitively states that coherence is assumed
and is therefore a receptive phenomena.
The incoherence Smith discusses is considerably different from when
the source of incoherence stems from
    the structure of the conversational text or
    relationship between different utterances
    - this is when another participant assesses,
        they are simply speaking leading a different conversation
        perhaps with a differing intention
        or that they are conversing under differing set of circumstances
        which manifests formally in the linguistic fabric of the conversation - its text.
        All that despite everyone included being cooperative.

Which incoherence sources are there for conversation?
---
Schegloff shows how incoherence arises when
people interpret sequence structure differently,
namely in terms of which turn is seen as an answer to which previously occuring turn.
In his example, the participants misread each other’s intentions,
leading to confusion about how their turns fit together.
They each project different expectations for how the conversation should unfold,
which causes misaligned sequence structure interpretations.
When this happens,
they turn to brief metacommunication—comments about the conversation itself
to try to clarify and re-align their understanding.
Schegloff illustrates how these
efforts to "repair" the misalignment are central to
managing and resolving incoherent moments in conversation.

Coherence disruptions are also discussed in linguistic literature.
---
Hrbáček’s approach to coherence and cohesion in text distinguishes the two concepts,
noting how they often interact but can also be independent.
He highlights that while
cohesion involves grammatical or lexical links that
make sentences flow together,
coherence relies on the logical and meaningful progression of ideas.
This means that a text could be cohesive -
using connectives, repetitions, and consistent lexical choices -
yet still lack coherence if the sequence of ideas doesn’t
make logical sense or
follow a clear progression.
Conversely, a text may be coherent in its narrative flow without
relying heavily on cohesive devices.
In Czech linguistics,
the distinction between téma (theme) and réma (rheme), as used by Daneš,
underlines the role of topic progression.
Hrbáček illustrates this by discussing examples where
a story progresses logically from one point to the next while
even if it does use typical cohesive markers,
it is not coherent as it never comes back a to previously mentioned topic.

This paper concerns itself with two phenomena - topic shifts and unassignable anaphore.
Looking at these phenomena as coherence disrupting is rarely done in literature.

Topic shifts
    When conversations shift abruptly from one topic to another,
    it can create confusion for the conversation partner.
    They might find themselves trying to
    reconnect to the previous discussion or
    wondering how the new subject relates.
    This can lead to misunderstandings,
    as the transition can feel jarring.

    One interesting question is,
    how do we determine when a topic has run its course?
    What common traits do conversations share when a subject is truly exhausted?
    Can observing transcripts reveal repeating patterns in topic progression or sequence structure?

    Moreover, what makes for a smooth transition between topics?
    Is it related to the cues participants give each other,
    or perhaps the context of the discussion?
    How do we navigate the flow of conversation and
    what indicates a natural shift versus a disruptive one?

Nonassignable anaphore
    Unassignable anaphore closely tied to topic progression
    Currently established topic or topics help assigning anaphore and
    determining	between an anaphore and an exophore.
    Even if an anaphoric device is not assignable,
    and the reference is presumably an exophoric one,
    The reason for employing this reference must be
    relevat to an established topic.
    In conversation meaning of demonstratives is to be negotiated.
    If an anaphores assignability causes confusion,
	chances are it is caused by one of the following
		-> there are no relevant assignment candidates
			-> this situation can be understood as a vague or unjustified exophore
		-> there are multiple equally relevant candidates
		-> candidate has occured in the conversation text too long ago
			-> can be understood as an abrupt return to previously established topic

What do participants do about coherence disruptions?
In conversation, coherence disruptions often prompt participants to
employ strategies to maintain understanding and flow.
Schegloff suggests that people manage these disruptions through interactive repair or inference.
Interactive repair often involves
explicitly addressing misunderstandings or clarifying intentions,
often by rephrasing or asking questions.
Interactive repair refers to immediate, collaborative corrections within dialogue,
where one speaker might correct the other or themselves to enhance clarity.
Inference and pragmatic reasoning, the most seamless methods,
allow participants to fill gaps based on context and social cues,
helping conversations continue smoothly without explicit repair.

Dingemans echoes these strategies from a cognitive perspective,
highlighting how inference and pragmatic reasoning are particularly effective.
Participants rely on shared understanding and contextual knowledge to interpret ambiguous statements.
Together, these strategies show how both
explicit (metacommunication and repair) and
implicit (inference and reasoning)
methods work to restore coherence,
underscoring the active role of participants in
constructing clear and meaningful exchanges.

It needs to be noted however that both interactive repair and reasoning are
deployed in a number of other contexts
other than conversation coherence disruption.
Inference takes place almost constantly as Garfinkel notes.
Each of those moments could be hardly considered a coherence disruption.
There is however always potential for it,
particularily via unclear or nonassignable anaphore or abrupt unjustified topic shifts.
Repair and metacommunication also takes place in a mutually informed and synchonized interaction.
It is for example deployed when conversation partners it is revealed to one or both
that their intentions or opinions differ.

These uses of interaction management are however
hardly possible to analyse on a textual level
since they do not cooccur with coherence disruptions.

	qualitative
		hardcoded phrase with intended unassignable anaphore is sometimes assignable by association
		limiting context for deep anaphore tends to generate inappropriate pragmatics
		limiting context for deep anaphore can lead to anaphore being open to a remap
		inquisitivity sometimes appreciated, other times considered lack of contribution
		deep anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as an abrupt shift to previous topic
		unassignable anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as a cataphore
		        cataphore is unimportant in conversation, it is a text phenomena
			    what is important is there is trust (or tolerance)
