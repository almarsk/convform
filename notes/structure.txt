COHERENCE DISRUPTIONS IN HUMAN-CHATBOT INTERACTION: TOWARDS QUANTITATIVE APPROACH TO CONVERSATION
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

INTRODUCTION
Recently, there has been a breakthrough in the way we interact with machines.
We can now instruct a computer using natural language, the human speech.
This opens new possibilities.
Besides making existing technology an extra step accessible,
new ways to use technology come up.
Automated interaction alone can solve previously unsolvable problems,
such as notably accessing a knowledge base.
Until recently a knowledge base would usually be accessed only via fulltext,
meaning we would only be able to find
information of which we knew a part of the formal encoding.
Today, we can search for information simply by asking questions,
all thanks to natural language computer interface.

The promise of much practical usage of the current wave of generative AI is ambitious
and only brings its fruit slowly, perhaps slower, than was expected.
There is talk of a "plateau" in development of the technology powering the current cutting edge inventions.
And that is not the only issue there is to the current wave of cutting edge AI.
    The electricity consumption is high and
    the societal impact is unpredictable and broad
to name the most prominent ones.

That being said, in context of conversation research,
this tool awakens temptation and curiosity.
With a partial control of what happens in the conversation and a decent certainty, that
our system will simulate human-human conversation to the user,
new kind of conversational data is in reach -
transcripts (or logs) of the human-bot interaction, that could be categorized based on
    which researcher controlled stimulus and
    which participant reaction to given stimulus
they contain.

In the 1960s the relatively recent emergence and adoption of telephone technology
allowed for recording and transcribing the most authentic conversational data to date.
This advancement took place thanks to developement in technology.
This is reminiscent of the current day situation.
While human-bot conversational data is arguably less authentic than telephone conversation transcripts,
experimental approach can be taken with the human element remaining present.

This papers task is two-fold.
Firstly it seeks to provide a debate on a metaresearch question -
is using generative AI a viable methodology for conversation research?
This is done by attempting to develop that very methodology.
Proceeding we operate in a frontier,
our first steps should be establishing data backed baseline knowledge
and assessing possible lines of research.

One way to understand what makes the unraveling text of a conversation
a valid one - a coherent one -
is obtaining conversational data containing coherence disruptions.
This can be done using the discussed technology -
it has the capability of conversing in a way
that is found generally acceptable by humans
and can drift away from the coherent interaction
if correctly instruced to do so.

The data this paper seeks to elicitate and analyse are
actual exchanges containing moments which
have the potential to be problematic for
the human participant to process and follow up on.
The line between what a coherent and an incoherent conversation is blurred.
It is in no way a binary property of the text of the conversation.
This approach has the potential however point out the divide between them.

While chatbots are evaluated for how natural and error free their way of conversing is,
humans in their conversation frequently
    make errors and
    temporarily disrupt conversational coherence
in the case of human-human communication, these disruptions can be cured easily.

It used to be (and remains so in legacy systems)
that in human-bot communication, disruptions could derail a conversation completely,
leaving the bot, who would only rely on surface level clues, in the dark.
This has become rare with generative AI. (Though it brings a set of its own problems.)
The cutting edge technology powered chatbots are
    better capable of understanding and producing relevant answers
    behind the scenes instructed so that
        they return to their conversational point of departure -
            offering help and service.

Human-bot communication is often single-purpose - there is a goal to be achieved.
The coherence of such conversation can then be described based on whether
the goal has been achieved with success and ease.
Another common scenario is a purpose-less conversation. It gets called chit-chat or smalltalk.
It can be described as open-domain.
An open-domain human-bot conversation is possible
though less common.
This type of conversation is a good candidate phenomena to be studied.
Since having the conversation is the purpose here,
the inner workings of what a conversation is step forward.
Some factors related to coherence in the text of conversation
    (whether it is human-human or human-bot)
have been discussed before.
Namely:
    convention and politeness   (Brown, Levinson)
    communication strategy      (Austin, Searl)
    conversational maxims       (Grice)
    sequence structure          (Schegloff, Sacks)
    message and topic           (???)
    ...
While all of the mentioned areas unveil a lot about the way conversation works,
rarely do they concern themselves with the textual dimension of conversation.
Most of the mentioned authors would hardly be described as linguists,
though their works significantly inform linguistics.
Yet, exceptions from this trend emerge in recent time.
Interaction linguistics branches out of conversation analysis and
points out specifically linguistic aspects in interaction to name a good example.

Opposed to interaction linguistics,
which remains focused on the social and temporal aspect of human-human interaction,
this paper will solely focus on the elements in conversational text,
that make it cohesive and coherent or rather
those that have the potential to prevent it from being those things.
The key concepts discussed in this paper are
coreference realized by anaphore and
closely related - topic; what the text is about.

BACKGROUND
Hrbáček, Halliday, Smith, Givón, Nedoluzhko, Izotopie (Daneš a další)

Textual dimension of conversation
In order to operate on a firm theoretical base, key terminology needs to be established.
The following concepts will be explained on their own terms and in relation to each other:
Text, coherence, cohesion, coreference, anaphore, cataphore, endophore, exophore, topic, entity and association.
The definitions draw from literature but attempt at creating their own sustainable model
without necesarily complying with given literature.

    Text
    Text is any semiotic structure.
    ...
    For the purpose of this paper however,
    let this definition be narrowed down to a structure that is
    linguistic, produced and percieved as intentional and coherent.
    The text of a conversation is multiproducer.
    This is not the only multiproducer text type out there.
    Another example of a multiproducer text
    would be a sequence of commercial signs on a busy street.
    It is the spatial juxtaposition of the signs and temporal juxtaposition of utterances,
    that make them a text.
    Another property of a conversation text is it is negotiated.
    This is given by its multiproducer and temporal nature.
    Other types of text which are also negotiated are relatively rare.
    There are occurences of debates which take place in written text,
    whether they are press columns or academic articles, which
    interact explicitly with each other, making them a negotiation.
    Such press discourse could however be considered
    a sequence of text units rather than a single temporarily juxtaposed text.
    This perspective could hardly be defended in regards to conversation, because
    its tight temporal coupling and cohesion,
    making conversation a unique phenomena.

    Coherence
    Coherence describes the degree to which a text is understandable and its intention clear.
    ...
    It is a property of the whole text, but
    textual elements can be pointed out that contribute to or diminish the given text coherence.
    Those elements are not referred to as "coherence elements";
    will be discussed below.
    Coherence is a cognitive phenomena
    ...
        - whether a written text is coherent depends mostly on the reader
        - whether a conversation text is coherent depends on an ongoing negotiation
    Coherence is a scalar property rather than a binary one.
    It is however tricky to measure.
    This papers approach is discussed below.
    To summarize,
    different levels of coherence disruptions are declared
    and the acceptance rates in participants are observed
    and corelation between
        those acceptance rates and
        level of coherence disruptions
    are sought for.
    True measuring of coherence is impossible since
    the degree to which a researched text is coherent
    is a part of the research question.
    Acceptance rate as a measurement also has its flaws.
    A combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis
        needs to be deployed.

    Cohesion
    Cohesion and coherence are sometimes used interchangebly.
    ...
    This paper handles both terms differently.
    Cohesion is not a property of text.
    In fact it is not any property at all.
    Instead it is an umbrella term
    covering specific relations within the structure of the text.
    Cohesive elements can be directly pinpointed in text.
    It interacts with coherence.
    A text does not need to be coherent in order to be cohesive. (Hrbáček)
    A coherent text tends to be at least somewhat cohesive.
    ... (Halliday)
    Following concepts can be considered cohesive elements.

    Anaphore, Endophore and coreference
    A common cohesive text element is an anaphore.
    It is a reference inside the text pointing back to a previously mentioned entity.
    Typically it is realised via demonstrative pronouns.
    Though there are other ways for anaphore to realise.
    In czech a common anaphoric element is a gendered suffix of a participle.
    ...

    An anaphoric element is by definition also endophoric (Halliday).
    It points inside the text it appears in.
    By definition an anaphoric element has a referent, which occures earlier in the text.
    These two elements are then coreferent.
    As such they also share an identical exophoric reference (Halliday) - they point outside of the text.

    In conversation, many aspects of which are subject to negotiation,
    specific coreference relations can be questioned as well.
    The reference realised by one communication participant may be unclear to the other
    resulting in a repair request.
    ...(other initiated other repair - Sacks).

    Cataphore and Exophore
    ... (Halliday)
    If a seemingly anaphoric text element is not succesfully mapped
    to a preceding textual coreferent
    the reference can still be understood, because shared context.
    Such element reaches out of the text with its reference, making it an exophoric one
    A related phenomena is a cataphore.
    Cataphore is a reference which points forward in the text.
    Such occurence is rare in written text and even more so in a conversation.
    In fact it is somehow pointless to account for cataphore in a multi-producer text.
    A cataphore denotes an authors intention to reveal
    the nature of a referent explicitly after first mentioning them.
    In conversation, where multiple contributors cocreate given text,
    and mutual understanding and agreement is the measure of
    how coherent the produced text is, later realisation of a vague reference
    does not contribute to how coherent it is.
    Regardless, in case of a cataphore, only the referent is a cohesive element,
    not the cataphore,
    as it ties back to the previous text, creating bonds across large textual units.

    Topic
    Topic is what a text is about.
    That makes topic very complicated to pinpoint.
    Among others, some issues with topic and annotating it in text are:
        A text can and typically does contain multiple topics
        Different framing will produce different topic annotations of text
        Topic annotation is by its nature always more text,
            so even it can be annotated for topic.
            making topic annotations recursive.
            One cannot therefore achieve a definite topic description of a text.
        A true strict formal approach to topic does not exist.
        A topic section can be impossible to delimit within text.
    Despite all these complications,
    topic cannot be set aside and ignored in conversation research
    as it is deeply intertwined with already mentioned concepts.
    Topic progressions across text are realised via anaphore and association
    and tightly interact with coherence.
    An appropriate amount of time has to be spend on a given topic unit,
    enough information has to be said about a given topic
    in order for it to be possible to move on or add another one in the conversation.
    A closure has to be provided in order for a topic to be done.
    Transitioning from one topic to another has a potential to disrupt coherence,
    if the association between the topics is too distant.
    A topical divergence has to be justified by a communicational intention.

    Association
    For the purpose of this paper association is textual realization of an isotopic relation. (Koblížek)
    By their exophoric properties, referents exist in a semantic web of relationships.
    Similarly to coherence, associative relationships are a cognitive phenomena.
    They come to exist when they are percieved.
    While association is a cohesive element it is difficult to formalize
    the way it can and has been done with anaphoric text relations.
    It is however a major factor in a coherence of text as
    in extreme cases a text can only rely on association in its coherence.

    Entity
    An entity is an exophoric referent.
    Words or text elements which can be reffered to by an anaphore will be called entities.
    Since a phrase containing an anaphore typically adds more information about the referent
    the new information must be semantically compatible,
    in other words association has to be possible between the referent and the added information.
    Entity also has to do with topic.
    Unfortunately not in a static way however.
    A topic can in text can be represented by a single entity or multiple.
    Coreferent words should be regarded as a single entity.
    It will serve to partially map a topic distance in text (not semantic).
    An extra layer of annotation might be required in some cases,
    but for now entity distance serves as a good enough approach.
    Review of this approach is one of the papers subtasks.
    More on that in the methodology section.

Interactional dimension of conversation
To define conversation in terms of previously introduced concepts,
one could see conversation as text which is produced by multiple producers
This complicates things
    conversation happens as opposed to text which is made
    conversational content is constantly negotiated by participants
    temporal and cooperative nature of conversation allows for
        overlaps
        swiftly corrected errors (a subset of repairs)
        multiple perspectives taking place
            each particiapnts perspective
            each idea of all the other participants perspectives
            each participants idea of the conversation text that is being cocreated
        all of these can desynchronize creating misunderstandings
        humans however are excellent at correcting misunderstandings
        this is because under regular circumstances, people cooperate
grice cooperation principle and maxims
...

modern conversation research reaches back to conversation analysis
thanks to recordings of phonecalls, transcripts could be qualitatively analyzed
this research has lead to coining new terminology:
    adjacency pair
    prefered answers
    topic shading
    sequence structure
this analysis has been practiced by sociologists, ethnometodologists
in modern day, there is a conversation analysis descendant called
interaction linguistics - topic and sequence
...

Disruptions in conversation coherence
While the question of what makes for a coherent text is broad,
to ask and answer what makes for a coherent conversation seems comfortably in reach.
Because conversation participants negotiate understanding,
it is up to them, when a conversation is and is not coherent
to describe what a coherent conversation is,
it is worth pursuing the moments, when the conversation stops working.
Such moments can be called coherence disruptions.
A coherence disruption is a complex phenomena as
    it penetrates through some or all of mentioned perspectives on an on-going conversation
    it can't be evaluated in a binary fashion
there are different degrees to which a conversation coherence can be disrupted
    if a participant suddenly starts speaking
    in an a way that can hardly be considered interaction
    due to its irrelevance or
    if the utterance simply is not grammatical and or understandable,
    while the conversation has been compromised and becomes incoherent,
    it has more to do with incoherent written text, because
    only one speaker is at the source of the incoherence
Smith
...
This is a considerably different phenomena from when
the source of incoherence stems from
    the structure of the conversational text or
    relationship between different utterances
    - this means another participant assesses,
        they are simply speaking leading a different conversation
        perhaps with a differing intention
        or that they are conversing under differing set of circumstances
        which manifests formally in the linguistic fabric of the conversation - its text.

Which incoherence sources are there for conversation?
schegloff - sequence structure
...

Coherence disruptions are also discussed in linguistic literature.
hrbáček - topic progression (issues)
...

This paper concerns itself with two phenomena - topic shifts and unassignable anaphore.
Looking at these phenomena as coherence disrupting is rarely done in literature.

    topic shifts
    		 -> abrupt topic shifts
             -> asking about a previously mentioned information
			 -> when is a topic exhausted?
			 -> what makes for a good segway?
    ...

    unassignable anaphore
			-> closely tied to topic
			    topic helps assigning anaphore and determining
				between an anaphore and an exophore
			-> in conversation meaning of demonstratives is to be negotiated
		if an anaphores assignability causes confusion,
		chances are it is caused by one of the following
				-> there are no relevant assignment candidates
					-> this situation can be understood as a vague exophore
					-> unassignability is something absent in exophore
							as long as assigning means
							mapping one concrete text element onto another
				-> there are multiple equally relevant candidates
				-> candidate has occured in the conversation text too long ago
					-> can be understood as an abrupt return to previously established topic
What do participants do about coherence disruptions?

Unassignable anaphore is underresearched
and it will serve as a suitable subject to work on our metaresearch question.
