INTRO 2
Recently, there has been a breakthrough in the way we interact with machines.
We can instruct a computer using natural language, the human speech.
This opens new possibilities.
Asides from making existing technology one step more accessible,
new ways to use technology come up.
Automated interaction alone can solve previously unsolvable problems,
such as notably accessing a knowledge base.
which until recently a knowledge base could be accessed only via fulltext,
meaning we would only be able to find
informations where we knew the formal encoding of a part of the information
today, we can search informations asking questions,
all thanks to natural language computer interface.

The promise of much practical usage of the current wave of generative AI is ambitious
and only brings its fruit slowly, perhaps slower, than was expected.
There is talk of a "plateau" in development of the technology powering current cutting edge inventions.
And there are more issues.
Generative AI technology consumes great deal of electricity and has unpredictable impact on society
to name the most prominent ones.

That being said, in context of conversation research,
this tool awakens temptation and curiosity.
With a partial control of what happens in the conversation and a decent certainty, that
our system will simulate actual human - human conversation in its coherence, it begs a question, whether
we could elicitate conversational data - transcripts (or logs) of the human - bot interaction,
that could be categorized based on
    which researcher controlled stimulus and
    which reaction to given stimulus
they contain.

In the 1960s the relatively recent emergence and adoption of telephone technology
allowed for recording and transcribing the most authentic conversational data to date.
This advancement took place thanks to developement in technology.

While human - bot conversational data is arguably less authentic,
experimental approach can be taken with the human element remaining present.
It remains true, that the current wave of development in AI
moves us a leap forward in understanding what conversation is -
for the first time in history, we have a conversating machine
and we can tell it what to do.

This papers task is two-fold.
Firstly it seeks to provide a debate on a metaresearch question -
is using generative AI a viable methodology for conversation research?
The way it does it is by attempting that very methodology.
If we proceed that we operate in a frontier,
the first steps should be establishing data backed baseline knowledge
and assessing possible lines of research.

focus on disruption - a blurred line between what is and isn't a coherent conversation
while chatbots are evaluated for how natural and error free their way of conversating is,
humans in their conversation frequently make errors and temporarily disrupt conversational coherence
in the case of human - human communication, these disruptions can be cured easily
in human - bot communication, disruptions can derail a conversation completely
this is often because a human - bot communication is frequently single-purpose - there is a goal to be achieved
an open-domain conversation, chit-chat or smalltalk if you will is also a coherent one
the factors related to an open-domain coherence are
    conventions - politeness
    communicational strategy - politeness
    intended content - message
such communication can too be held between a human and a bot
now that the natural language interface for communication with computers has been established
the technology behind this interface is a model probabilistic in nature
the model output is unpredictable and
the only adjustments we can do to it
have the form of natural language


THEORY 15
Hrbáček, Halliday, Smith, Givón, Nedoluzhko, Izotopie (Daneš a další)

Text
In order to operate on a firm base, we need to equip ourselves with some theory.
The following concepts need to be explained on their own terms and in relation to each other:
Text, coherence, cohesion, anaphore, cataphore, endophore, exophore, topic, entity and association.

    Text
    linguistic, written - intentional, juxtaposed, coherent, spatial
    spoken - multiproducer, negotiated, temporal

    This is as far as we need to go to suffice the topic of this paper,
    but it is worth noting that the notion of text can go way further,
    if we take semiotics and poststructuralism in the picture.

    Coherence
    what makes text understandable.
    property of text as a whole
    cognitive
        - whether a written text is coherent depends mostly on the reader
        - whether a spoken text is coherent depends on an ongoing negotiation
    examples

    Cohesion
    cohesion is not a property of text or anything else
    umbrella concept covering specific relations within the structure of the text
    cohesive text does not need to be coherent
    examples (Hrbáček)

    Anaphore and Endophore
    a reference inside the text pointing back
    typically demonstratives or gendered flective endings
    a cohesive element
    anaphore referent can be subject to negotiation in conversation

    Cataphore and Exophore - a thin line
    a reference pointing towards in text
    unimportant for conversation
        understanding is achieved through trust and compliance with promise
        demonstrative lacking referent can point forward in text,
        but can simply be understood via shared knowledge of speakers
        making it an exophore
        difference here is formal and unimportant
        as given referent is activated in speakers minds
    referent of a cataphore is a realized potential of an exophore
    only the referent is a cohesive element

    Topic
    content of text, what is it about
    difficult to delimit
    topic development within text is realized via anaphore and association
    the topic composition of text contributes to text coherence

    Association
    textual realization of an isotopic relation
    cohesive element, difficult to formalize

    Entity
    for the purpose of this paper, another concept is added - an entity
    entity somewhat overlaps with topic,
    but a single topic can contain several entities within a text
    entity is typically a noun in text,
    which can be meaningfully reffered to by an anaphore
    or can realize an exophore potential making it a cataphore
    has cohesive potential

Conversation
To define conversation in terms of previously introduced concepts,
one could see conversation as text which is produced by multiple producers
This complicates things
    conversation happens as opposed to text which is made
    conversational content is constantly negotiated by participants
    temporal and cooperative nature of conversation allows
        overlaps
        swiftly corrected errors
        there is multiple perspectives
            each particiapnts perspective
            each idea of all the other participants perspectives
            each participants idea of the conversation text that is being cocreated
        all of these can fall out of sync creating misunderstandings
        humans however are pretty good at correcting misunderstandings
        this is because under regular circumstances, people cooperate
grice cooperation principle and maxims

conversation as such has long been considered chaotic
the origin of modern conversation research is conversation analysis
thanks to recordings of phonecalls, transcripts could be qualitatively analyzed
    adjacency pair
    prefered answers
    topic shading
    sequence structure
this analysis has been practiced by sociologists, ethnometodologists
in modern day, there is a conversation analysis descendant called
interaction linguistics - topic and sequence

Disruptions
While the question of what makes for a coherent text is very broad,
to ask and answer what makes for a coherent conversation seems comfortably in reach
since conversation participants negotiate understanding,
it is up to them, when a conversation is and is not coherent
to describe a coherent what a functioning conversation is,
it is worth pursuing the moments, when the conversation stops working,
we could call those coherence disruptions
a coherence disruption is a complex phenomena,
    it penetrates through some or all of mentioned perspectives on an on-going conversation
    it can't be evaluate in a binary fashion
        there are different degrees to which a conversation coherence can be disrupted
if a participant suddenly starts speaking in an uncoherent way on their own,
if the utterance simply is not grammatical and or understandable,
while the conversation has been compromised and becomes incoherent,
it has more to do with incoherent written text, because
only one speaker is at the source of the incoherence
- Smith
it is a considerably different phenomena from when
the source of incoherence stems from
    the structure of the conversational text or
    relationship between different utterances

which incoherence sources are there for conversation?
schegloff - sequence structure
hrbáček - topic progression (issuez)
    topic shifts
    		-> abrupt topic shifts
			 -> when is a topic exhausted?
			 -> what makes for a good segway?
unassignable anaphore
			-> it is to be negotiated what is the topic
			-> meaning of demonstratives is to be negotiated
			-> types of confusing assignability
				-> no candidates
					-> can be understood as a promis of a cataphore/exophorically
				-> multiple candidates
				-> candidate too long ago
					-> can be understood as an abrupt return to previously established topic
so what do participants do about it?
schegloff again
dingemans
    metacommunication, interactive repair
    inference, pragmatic reasoning

Conclusion
    unassignable anaphore is underresearched
    and a perfect area to work on our metaresearch question

	qualitative
		hardcoded phrase with intended unassignable anaphore is sometimes assignable by association
		limiting context for deep anaphore tends to generate inappropriate pragmatics
		limiting context for deep anaphore can lead to anaphore being open to a remap
		inquisitivity sometimes appreciated, other times considered lack of contribution
		deep anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as an abrupt shift to previous topic
		unassignable anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as a cataphore
		        cataphore is unimportant in conversation, it is a text phenomena
			    what is important is there is trust (or tolerance)
	further steps
