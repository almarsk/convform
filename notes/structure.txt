COHERENCE DISRUPTIONS IN HUMAN-CHATBOT INTERACTION: TOWARDS QUANTITATIVE APPROACH TO CONVERSATION
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

INTRO 2
Recently, there has been a breakthrough in the way we interact with machines.
We can now instruct a computer using natural language, the human speech.
This opens new possibilities.
Besides making existing technology an extra step accessible,
new ways to use technology come up.
Automated interaction alone can solve previously unsolvable problems,
such as notably accessing a knowledge base.
Until recently a knowledge base would usually be accessed only via fulltext,
meaning we would only be able to find
information knew part of the formal encoding of.
Today, we can search for information simply asking questions,
all thanks to natural language computer interface.

The promise of much practical usage of the current wave of generative AI is ambitious
and only brings its fruit slowly, perhaps slower, than was expected.
There is talk of a "plateau" in development of the technology powering the current cutting edge inventions.
And that is not the only issue there is to the current wave of cutting edge AI.
    The electricity consumption is high and
    the societal impact is unpredictable and broad
to name the most prominent ones.

That being said, in context of conversation research,
this tool awakens temptation and curiosity.
With a partial control of what happens in the conversation and a decent certainty, that
our system will simulate human-human conversation to the user,
new kind of conversational data is in reach -
transcripts (or logs) of the human-bot interaction, that could be categorized based on
    which researcher controlled stimulus and
    which participant reaction to given stimulus
they contain.

In the 1960s the relatively recent emergence and adoption of telephone technology
allowed for recording and transcribing the most authentic conversational data to date.
This advancement took place thanks to developement in technology.
This is reminiscent of the current day situation.
While human-bot conversational data is arguably less authentic,
experimental approach can be taken with the human element remaining present.

This papers task is two-fold.
Firstly it seeks to provide a debate on a metaresearch question -
is using generative AI a viable methodology for conversation research?
This is done by attempting to develop that very methodology.
Proceeding we operate in a frontier,
our first steps should be establishing data backed baseline knowledge
and assessing possible lines of research.

One way to understand what makes the unraveling text of a conversation
a valid one - a coherent one,
is obtaining conversational data containing coherence disruptions.
This can be done using the discussed technology -
it has the capability of conversing in a way
that is found generally acceptable by humans
and can drift away from the coherent interaction
if correctly instruced to do so.

The data this paper seeks to elicitate and analyse are
actual exchanges containing moments which
have the potential to be problematic for
the human participant to process and follow up on.
The line between what a coherent and an incoherent conversation is blurred.
It is in no way a binary property of the text of the conversation.
This approach can however point out the divide between them.

While chatbots are evaluated for how natural and error free their way of conversating is,
humans in their conversation frequently
    make errors and
    temporarily disrupt conversational coherence
in the case of human-human communication, these disruptions can be cured easily.

It used to be (and remains in legacy systems)
that in human-bot communication, disruptions could derail a conversation completely,
leaving the bot, who would only rely on surface level clues, in the dark.
This has become rare with generative AI.
The cutting edge technology powered chatbots are
    better capable of understanding and producing relevant answers
    behind the scene instructed so that
    they return to their conversational point of departure -
offering help and service.

Human-bot communication is often single-purpose - there is a goal to be achieved.
The coherence of such conversation can then be described based on whether
the goal has been achieved with success and ease.
An open-domain (also called chit-chat or smalltalk) human-bot conversation is possible
though less common.
Some factors related to coherence in open-domain conversation
(whether it is human-human or human-bot) stem from
    convention and politeness   (Brown, Levinson)
    communication strategy      (Austin, Searl)
    conversational maxims       (Grice)
    sequence structure          (Schegloff, Sacks)
    message and topic           (???)
While all of the mentioned areas teach us a lot about the way conversation works,
rarely do they concern themselves with the textual dimension of conversation.
Most of the mentioned authors works could hardly be described as linguists,
even though their works significantly inform linguistics.
Yet, exceptions from this trend have emerged.
Interaction linguistics branches out of conversation analysis and
points out specifically linguistic aspects in interaction to name a good example.

As opposed to interaction linguistics,
which remains focused on the social and temporal aspect of human-human interaction,
this paper will solely focus on the elements in conversational text,
that make it cohesive and coherent.
The key concepts that give text these properties is
coreference realized by anaphore and
closely related topic; what the text is about.

The previously mentioned research fields inform about these concepts.
With their help and the help of modern day technology
this paper attempts to take a step further in
understanding nature of conversation.

THEORY 15
Hrbáček, Halliday, Smith, Givón, Nedoluzhko, Izotopie (Daneš a další)

Textual dimension of conversation
In order to operate on a firm theoretical base, key terminology needs to be established.
The following concepts will be explained on their own terms and in relation to each other:
Text, coherence, cohesion, coreference, anaphore, cataphore, endophore, exophore, topic, entity and association.

    Text
    Text is any semiotic structure.
    For the purpose of this paper however,
    we will narrow this definition down to a structure that is
    linguistic, produced and percieved as intentional and coherent.
    A text of conversation is multiproducer.
    This is not the only multiproducer text type out there.
    Another obivous example of a multiproducer text
    would be a sequence of commercial signs on a busy street.
    It is the spatial juxtaposition of the signs and temporal juxtaposition of utterances,
    that make them a text.
    Another property of conversation text is it is negotiated.
    This is given by its multiproducer and temporal nature.
    Other types of text which are also negotiated are relatively rare.
    There are occurences of debates which take place in written text,
    whether they are press columns or academic articles, which
    interact explicitly with each other, making them a negotiation.
    Another highly specific example is a so called rap beef.
    This is when two rappers take turns releasing music
    (or just improvising on the spot)
    that is trying to belittle the opponent.
    Both rap battling and press discourse can however be considered
    sequences of related text units rather than a single temporarily juxtaposed text.

    This perspective could hardly be defended in regards to conversation, because
    its tight temporal coupling and cohesion,
    making conversation a unique phenomena.

    Coherence
    Coherence is what makes text understandable and its intention clear.
    It is a property of the whole text, but
    textual elements can be pointed out that contribute to or diminish the given text coherence.
    Those elements are not refered to as "coherence elements" and will be discussed below.
    Coherence is a cognitive phenomena
        - whether a written text is coherent depends mostly on the reader
        - whether a conversation text is coherent depends on an ongoing negotiation
    Coherence is a scalar property rather than a binary one.
    It is however tricky to measure.
    This papers approach is discussed below, but to summarize,
    different levels of coherence disruptions are declared
    and the corelation with acceptance rates in participants is observed.
    True measuring of coherence is impossible since
    the degree to which a researched text is coherent
    is a part of the research question.

    Cohesion
    Cohesion is not a property of text or of anything else.
    Instead it is an umbrella term
    covering specific relations within the structure of the text.
    Cohesive elements can be directly pinpointed in text.
    It interacts with coherence.
    A text does not need to be coherent in order to be cohesive. (Hrbáček)
    A coherent text tends to be at least somewhat cohesive.
    Following concepts can be considered cohesive elements.

    Anaphore, Endophore and coreference
    A common cohesive text element is an anaphore.
    It is a reference inside the text pointing back to a previously mentioned entity.
    Typically it is realised via demonstrative pronouns.
    Though there are other ways for anaphore to realise.
    In czech a common anaphoric element is a gendered suffix of a participle.
    ...
    An anaphoric element is by definition also endophoric (Halliday).
    It points inside the text it appears in.
    By definition an anaphoric element has a referent, which occures earlies in the text.
    These two elements are then coreferent.
    As such they also share an identical exophoric reference - they point outside of the text.

    In conversation, where the text is cocreated
    just like other aspects of it
    the specific coreference relations are subject to negotiation.
    The reference realised by one communication participant may be unclear to the other.

    Cataphore and Exophore
    If a suspicion arises, that the seemingly anaphoric text element
    a reference pointing towards in text
    unimportant for conversation
        understanding is achieved through trust and compliance with promise
        demonstrative lacking referent can point forward in text,
        but can simply be understood via shared knowledge of speakers
        making it an exophore
        difference here is formal and unimportant
        as given referent is activated in speakers minds
    referent of a cataphore is a realized potential of an exophore
    only the referent is a cohesive element

    Topic
    content of text, what is it about
    difficult to delimit
    topic development within text is realized via anaphore and association
    the topic composition of text contributes to text coherence

    Association
    textual realization of an isotopic relation
    cohesive element, difficult to formalize

    Entity
    for the purpose of this paper, another concept is added - an entity
    entity somewhat overlaps with topic,
    but a single topic can contain several entities within a text
    entity is typically a noun in text,
    which can be meaningfully reffered to by an anaphore
    or can realize an exophore potentially making it a cataphore
    has cohesive potential

Interactional dimension of conversation
To define conversation in terms of previously introduced concepts,
one could see conversation as text which is produced by multiple producers
This complicates things
    conversation happens as opposed to text which is made
    conversational content is constantly negotiated by participants
    temporal and cooperative nature of conversation allows
        overlaps
        swiftly corrected errors
        there is multiple perspectives
            each particiapnts perspective
            each idea of all the other participants perspectives
            each participants idea of the conversation text that is being cocreated
        all of these can fall out of sync creating misunderstandings
        humans however are pretty good at correcting misunderstandings
        this is because under regular circumstances, people cooperate
grice cooperation principle and maxims

conversation as such has long been considered chaotic
the origin of modern conversation research is conversation analysis
thanks to recordings of phonecalls, transcripts could be qualitatively analyzed
    adjacency pair
    prefered answers
    topic shading
    sequence structure
this analysis has been practiced by sociologists, ethnometodologists
in modern day, there is a conversation analysis descendant called
interaction linguistics - topic and sequence

Disruptions in conversation coherence
While the question of what makes for a coherent text is very broad,
to ask and answer what makes for a coherent conversation seems comfortably in reach
since conversation participants negotiate understanding,
it is up to them, when a conversation is and is not coherent
to describe a coherent what a functioning conversation is,
it is worth pursuing the moments, when the conversation stops working,
we could call those coherence disruptions
a coherence disruption is a complex phenomena,
    it penetrates through some or all of mentioned perspectives on an on-going conversation
    it can't be evaluate in a binary fashion
        there are different degrees to which a conversation coherence can be disrupted
if a participant suddenly starts speaking in an uncoherent way on their own,
if the utterance simply is not grammatical and or understandable,
while the conversation has been compromised and becomes incoherent,
it has more to do with incoherent written text, because
only one speaker is at the source of the incoherence
- Smith
it is a considerably different phenomena from when
the source of incoherence stems from
    the structure of the conversational text or
    relationship between different utterances

which incoherence sources are there for conversation?
schegloff - sequence structure
hrbáček - topic progression (issuez)
    topic shifts
    		 -> abrupt topic shifts
			 -> when is a topic exhausted?
			 -> what makes for a good segway?
unassignable anaphore
			-> it is to be negotiated what is the topic
			-> meaning of demonstratives is to be negotiated
			-> types of confusing assignability
				-> no candidates
					-> can be understood as a promis of a cataphore/exophorically
				-> multiple candidates
				-> candidate too long ago
					-> can be understood as an abrupt return to previously established topic
so what do participants do about it?
schegloff again

    metacommunication, interactive repair
    inference, pragmatic reasoning

Conclusion
    unassignable anaphore is underresearched
    and a perfect area to work on our metaresearch question

		limiting context for deep anaphore tends to generate inappropriate pragmatics
		limiting context for deep anaphore can lead to anaphore being open to a remap
		inquisitivity sometimes appreciated, other times considered lack of contribution
		deep anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as an abrupt shift to previous topic
		unassignable anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as a cataphore
		        cataphore is unimportant in conversation, it is a text phenomena
