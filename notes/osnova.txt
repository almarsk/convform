cohesion, coherence, text				- Hrbáček, Halliday, Smith, Givón, Nedoluzhko
	anaphore, cataphore
	endophore, exophore

conversation, social, multiperspective
- Sacks, Schegloff, Interaction linguistics, Grice

    conversation text
    constant negotiation
    cooperation principle
    conversation maxims
    conversation analysis
    adjacency pair
    prefered answer
	topic shading
    sequence structure


disruptions						- Hrbáček, Smith, Dingemans, Garfinkel
	possible issues:
		-> unassignable anaphore
			-> it is to be negotiated what is the topic
			-> meaning of demonstratives is to be negotiated
			-> degrees of assignability
				-> no candidates
					-> can be understood cataphorically
				-> multiple candidates
				-> candidate too long ago
					-> can be understood as an abrupt return to previously established topic
		-> abrupt topic shifts
			-> when is a topic exhausted?
			-> what makes for a good segway?
	reactions:
		-> metacommunication; interactive repair
		-> inference; pragmatic reasoning

METHODOLOGY
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

methodology - chatbot
	partial control
	illusion of social interaction can fall along with perception of coherence
	using ai to have people define the topic
		rule based approach
		ai based approach
		hybrid
		convform
	causing a unified type of disruption at correct time
	2x3
	conversational style
		inquisitive
		relaxed
	anaphore
		shallow
		deep
		unassignable

	annotated by hand
	stimulus checked
	confirmed / updated / excluded
	metrics
		rating
		reaction to stimulus
		% aborted
		mentions in comment

PILOT STUDY
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

unassignable anaphore
	expectations
		rating
			from best to worse: shallow, deep, unassignable
		abort
			from least to most : shallow, deep, unassignable
		reactions
			shallow 	- continue
			deep		- meta
			unassignable 	- abort
		inquisitive will be more negative
	results
		rating
			✔ from best to worse: shallow, deep, unassignable
			⛌ inquisitive scores higher
		abort
			⛌ deep and unassignable same amount of aborts
			✔ inquisitive significantly more aborts for unassignable
			✔ comments confirm this
			⛌ inquisitive slightly less aborts for deep
		reactions
			✔ tendency manifested
			⛌ deep and unassignable same amount of meta
			✔ deep and unassignable mirroring continue and abort
	qualitative
		hardcoded phrase with intended unassignable anaphore is sometimes assignable by association
		limiting context for deep anaphore tends to generate inappropriate pragmatics
		limiting context for deep anaphore can lead to anaphore being open to a remap
		inquisitivity sometimes appreciated, other times considered lack of contribution
		deep anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as an abrupt shift to previous topic
		unassignable anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as a cataphore
		        cataphore is unimportant in conversation, it is a text phenomena
			    what is important is there is trust (or tolerance)
	further steps
		making the questionnaire more detailed
			convlog
		replicate current results
		annotator agreement on stimulus annotations
		why inquisitive conversation style seems to be more likely to be appreciated?
		what signifies appreciation / dissatisfaction in inquisitive conversation style? (router)
		at which point does deep anaphore become unassignable?
		when does associativity help assign an otherwise unassignable anaphore?

CENTERING
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

formal tool to discuss depth, assignability, ambivalence and associativity of anaphore
centering						- Kibble, Poesio
	unit - phrase, sentence, turn
	CB - anaphore, reinstation
	CF - candidate
	CP - ranking ??
	entity coherence

			CB(Un) = CB(Un−1) or CB(Un−1) = NIL 		CB(Un) ̸= CB(Un−1)
CB(Un) = CP(Un)			Continue				  Smooth Shift
CB(Un) ̸= CP(Un) 	      Retain 					Rough Shift

	what is missing
		ranking (CP) has to be determined intuitively (annotator agreement?)
		max lookback is 1
			can CB be mapped on any preceding entity?
		nonidentity of CB and CP
			entity coherence

MAIN STUDY
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

	conversation design
		depth of anaphore somehow?
		improving deep of anaphore pragmatics
		make unassignable anaphore be generated by prompt
	data collection and processing
		using centering theory derived formal apparatus to better describe and categorize stimuli
		annotator agreement
		more detailed questionnare
		larger number of participants
			larger number of data points
			larger margin for excluding conversations
			annotator agreement
	data analysis
		replicating pilot study?
		looking closer into conversational style
		comparing metrics from detailed questionnare
	qualitative analysis

CONCLUSION
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

	can we look at conversation quantitatively?
	what else can be done?
