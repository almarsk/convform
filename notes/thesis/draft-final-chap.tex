\subsection{Expectations}
rating
from best to worse: shallow, deep, nonassignable
abort
from least to most: shallow, deep, nonassignable
reactions
shallow 	– continue
deep		– meta
nonassignable 	– abort
inquisitive will be more negative

\subsection{Result}

rating, reaction, comment

\paragraph{Rating overall}
Ratings between 1 and 5:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rating 1: 22 times
\item Rating 2: 62 times
\item Rating 3: 138 times
\item Rating 4: 37 times
\item Rating 5: 6 times
\item No rating: 19 times
\end{itemize}
Ratio stimulus shallow:deep:nonassignable:other 104:64:116:85
Ratio stimulus with rating shallow:deep:nonassignable:other 102:58:105:71

\subsubsection{Design rating}
number rating is very noisy, other things happen in conversation that affect it

\begin{itemize}
\item Rating shlw 2.7549019607843137
\item Rating deep 2.5344827586206895
\item Rating nass 2.9523809523809526
\end{itemize}

Surprisingly shallow anaphora has worse score than deep anaphora.

\begin{itemize}
\item Kruskal-Wallis Test p-value: 0.020462703785719412
\item Effect Size (Eta Squared): 0.029688178453053583
\item Comparison: deep vs nonassignable, p-value: 0.0048713423950883464
\item Comparison: deep vs shallow, p-value: 0.1582978409422613
\item Comparison: nonassignable vs shallow, p-value: 0.136917898603309
\end{itemize}

Only significant for deep vs nonassignable.

\subsubsection{Design rating with abandonment interpretation}

\paragraph{Abandoned directly after stimulus}

Some conversations do not have a rating (participant clicked off of the experiment webpage)
These conversations can be interpreted as worse possible reaction - 5.

We can further split these into a situation where the participant clicked off of the experiment
right after the stimulus - this only happened in case of nonassignable anaphora design.

\begin{itemize}
\item Ratio stimulus null rating shallow:deep:nonassignable 2:6:11
\item Rating incl null direct shlw 2.7549019607843137
\item Rating incl null direct deep 2.5344827586206895
\item Rating incl null direct nass 3.063063063063063
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rating diff nonull vs null direct shlw 0.0
\item Rating diff nonull vs null direct deep 0.0
\item Rating diff nonull vs null direct nass -0.11068211068211031
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Abandoned anytime}

Or we can interpret as worse rating if participant clicked off at any time:

\begin{itemize}
\item Rating incl null anytime shlw 2.798076923076923
\item Rating incl null anytime deep 2.765625
\item Rating incl null anytime nass 3.146551724137931
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rating diff nonull vs null anytime shlw -0.0431749622926092
\item Rating diff nonull vs null anytime deep -0.2311422413793105
\item Rating diff nonull vs null anytime nass -0.1941707717569785
\end{itemize}

The difference shows that the shallow anaphora had by far the least people just leaving.

\begin{itemize}
\item Kruskal-Wallis Test p-value: 0.017698134990819445
\item Effect Size (Eta Squared): 0.02871385062422946
\item Comparison: deep vs nonassignable, p-value: 0.01597013599420015
\item Comparison: deep vs shallow, p-value: 0.652654604765214
\item Comparison: nonassignable vs shallow, p-value: 0.018874560457834404
\end{itemize}

Here the results are more significant but still not for deep vs shallow.
There are many factors in the conversation data and
stimulus does not seem to have a strong enough effect on the rating.
If better more seamless conversation could be simulated,
perhaps stronger effect of the stimulus on rating could be observed.
The small difference can also be attributed to the fact that participants tend to
avoid extremes in their grading.

\subsubsection{Reaction to stimulus}

\begin{itemize}
\item Reaction ratio shlw continuation:meta:abort 91:08:05
\item Reaction ratio deep continuation:meta:abort 34:26:04
\item Reaction ratio nass continuation:meta:abort 13:57:46
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Reaction percentage ratio shlw 87.50% : 7.69% : 4.81%
\item Reaction percentage ratio deep 53.12% : 40.62% : 6.25%
\item Reaction percentage ratio nass 11.21% : 49.14% : 39.66%
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Chi2 Statistic: 139.0566579414896
\item P-value: 4.4935956067223523e-29
\item Degrees of Freedom: 4
\item Expected Frequencies:
\item [[50.53521127 31.09859155 56.36619718]
\item [33.32394366 20.50704225 37.16901408]
\item [20.14084507 12.3943662  22.46478873]]
\end{itemize}

Significant difference.

\subsubsection{Stimulus x Reaction specific ratings}

\begin{itemize}
\item     | cntn | meta | abrt |
\item shlw | 2.73 | 3.12 | 2.60 | stimulus x stimulus reaction match True
\item deep | 2.43 | 2.62 | 2.75 | stimulus x stimulus reaction match True
\item nass | 2.45 | 3.04 | 2.98 | stimulus x stimulus reaction match True
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Comments}

\begin{itemize}
\item Types of comments:
\item Stimulus mentioned in comments 80 times
\item shlw mentioned 00 times in comments - goes unnoticed
\item deep mentioned 11 times in comments - sometimes mentioned
\item nass mentioned 69 times in comments - mentioned in over half of the cases
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Conversation style}

\begin{itemize}
\item Relaxed style convos 128
\item Inquisitive style convos 183
\item Inquisitive style rating 2.63
\item Relaxed style rating 2.45
\item Relaxed style addressed in comments: 1x positive 1x negative
\item Inquistive style addressed in comments: 1x negative
\end{itemize}

Kruskal-Wallis Test p-value: 0.10266771117843472\
Effect Size (Eta Squared): 0.009445412958117978

Very small effect.
To find statistically significant effect on conversation styles
the conversation needs to be controlled in a more nuanced way by the dialog system.

relaxed style is often reduced to repetition
67 relaxed style not appreciated

\subsubsection{Zero anaphora}

Number of zero anaphora conversations: 16\
stimulus zero anaphora shallow:deep:nonassignable 08:08:00\
Rating zero anaphora continuation:meta:abort 14:02:00

Rating zero anaphora 2.1875\
Rating non zero anaphora 2.7291666666666665

Zero anaphora seems to have much better scores.
Anaphorization has to incorporate zero anaphore better in the future.\
357 here zero anaphore does not work\
347 shouldve dropped

\section{Qualitative analysis}

2
\subsubsection{Pro-coherence perception}
\paragraph{Remaps}
    100, 316, 53, 257 will map if can
    126, 49, 330, 157, 175, 236 remap
    259 epic remap
    36 jaké další knihy ti doporučili ? general third person is accepted
    276, 275 nonassignable interpreted as third person participant reference
    243 misunderstood reference
    limiting context for deep anaphore can lead to anaphore being open to a remap
\paragraph{Indirect anaphora -- Pseudoanaphora}
    hardcoded phrase with intended nonassignable anaphore is sometimes assignable by association
    106, 271p, 212, 248, 260 pseudoanaphora
    149 unmapped pseudoanaphora (mediace při rozvodu)
    spectrum between pseudoanaphora and a newly mentioned entity anaphorized
\paragraph{Sequential coherence}
    123 sequentially interesting

2
\subsection{Deep anaphore}
    too simplified a notion
    remaps
    253 perfect
    30 clear mapping due to verb
\paragraph{Inappropriate pragmatics}
    127, 145 repeating a question - topical/pragmatic incoherence
        limiting context for deep anaphore tends to generate inappropriate pragmatics
    162, 114 stimulus understood but topic shift not accepted

\paragraph{Incomplete control over conversation - topic status}
    96, 168, 192, 203, 240, 245 not moving away from topic
    337 anaphore refers to hyperonymum of previous utterance entities
    312 vague anaphore, but on topic

    deep anaphora design has multiple scenarios it tends to go in:
    deep with generation issue
    deep with acceptance
    deep within same topic, other within same topic

    deep anaphora acceptance depends on
    whether the topic shift is annotated, accepted and
    whether there is enough information to perform mapping

1
\subsection{Nonassignable anaphore}
mostly fine

\paragraph{Returning to entities that havent been topicalized}
    162 graph according to Daneš

    b: Jaký je T1?
    h: R2 a R3
    b: Jaký je T2?
    h: R2a R2b R2c
    dodělat !!

    entity of q anaphore returned to is not topicalized at any point
    as opposed to 145 where entity of q anaphore is topicalized
    ...

\paragraph{acceptance}
    142 changed topic upon nonassignable
    279 continuing despite nonassignability

1
\paragraph{Evaluation of shallow, deep, nonassignable categorization}
deep anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as an abrupt shift to previous topic
nonassignable anaphore (if accepted) tends to be seen as a cataphore
    cataphore is unimportant in conversation, it is a text phenomena
    what is important is there is trust (or tolerance)
		It is hard to just change the anaphore - always more factors, some stronger in their influence on coherence:

1
\subsection{Outside of stimuli}

\subsubsection{Topical coherence}
    264p topic incoherence
    190 didnt get to stimulus, not enough topic in conversation?

\subsubsection{Metacommunication}
    317 metacommunication
    270 double anaphore -> meta
    274 almost meta
    101 meta but ended shortly after, coherence would not recover
