\par
Recently, there has been a breakthrough in the way we interact with machines \footcite{sharma2024exploring}.
We can now instruct a computer using natural language \footcite{hendrix1982natural}.
Besides making existing technology an extra step accessible,
new ways to use technology appear.
Being able to simply talk to a machine and have it respond
can help overcome longstanding challenges
such as notably accessing a knowledge base via semantic search \footcite{makela2005survey}.
Until recently a knowledge base would usually be accessed via fulltext,
meaning we would only be able to find
information of which we knew a part of the formal encoding.
Today, we can search for information simply by asking questions,
including follow up ones
all thanks to natural language computer interface.
\par
The promise of much practical usage of the current wave of generative AI is ambitious
and only brings its fruit slowly, perhaps slower, than was expected
\footcite{bloomberg2024openai1}\footcite{reuters2024openai}.
There is talk of a "plateau" in development of the technology powering
the current cutting edge inventions \footcite{ritter2024ai}.
That besides the current day issues of cutting edge AI like
high electricity consumption \footcite{ritchie2024ai} and
unpredictable and broad societal impact \footcite{hagerty2019global}\footcite{baldassarre2023social}

That being said, in context of conversation research,
this development in technology promises to make things possible that previously were not.
With a partial control of what happens in the conversation and a decent certainty, that
our system will simulate human–human conversation to the user,
new kind of conversational data is in reach –
logs of the human–bot interaction, that could be categorized based on

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    which researcher controlled stimulus and
    \item
    which participant reaction to given stimulus
\end{itemize}

they contain.

\par
In the 1960s the relatively recent emergence and adoption of telephone technology
allowed for recording and transcribing authentic conversational data.
This advancement took place thanks to developement in technology
which is reminiscent of the current day situation.
While human–bot conversational data is arguably less authentic than telephone conversation transcripts,
experimental approach can be taken while the human element is present.

\par
This papers intention is to provide a debate on a metaresearch question –
is using generative AI a viable methodology for conversation research?
This is done by attempting to develop that very methodology.
Proceeding we operate in a frontier,
our first steps should be establishing data backed baseline knowledge
and assessing possible lines of research.

\par
Understanding what makes
the unraveling text of a conversation a coherent one
can be approached via obtaining
conversational data containing coherence disruptions.
This used to be difficult in the past () but
can be done using the discussed technology –
it has the capability of conversing in a way
that is found generally acceptable by humans
and can drift away from the coherent interaction
if appropriately instruced to do so.

\par
The data this paper seeks to elicitate and analyse are
actual human–chatbot exchanges containing moments which
have the potential to be problematic for
the human participant to process and follow up on.
The boundary between what a coherent and an incoherent conversation is blurred.
It is in no way a binary property of the text of the conversation ().
The goal is therefore to touch on the gradual divide between them.

.. () Bublitz \footcite{bublitz1999disturbed}

\par
While chatbots are evaluated for how natural and error free their way of conversing is,
human–human conversation is rarely flawless as
errors happen and
conversational coherence gets temporarily disrupted
In case of human–human communication, disruptions can however be cured easily ().

\par
In human–bot communication, disruptions could derail a conversation completely,
leaving the bot, who would only rely on surface level textual clues, in the dark. \footcite{mctear2020conversational}
This has become rare with generative AI.
Even though it brings a set of its own problems like
frequently lacking factuality or
the difficulty to handle data responsibly,
the cutting edge technology powered conversation systems are

\begin{itemize}
\item
   better capable of understanding and producing relevant answers

\item
   able to return to their conversational point of departure
\end{itemize}

\par
Human–bot communication is often single–purpose.
Companies and institutions deploy voice applications to interact with customers and clients,
so there is usually a goal to be achieved.
The coherence in each moment of such conversation can then be described based on whether
the goal is currently coming closer to being achieved with ease.
Another common frame for a human–bot interaction is an open–domain conversation,
also known as chit–chat or smalltalk ().
Since there is no global goal to achieve,
the coherence of such interaction is dictated by
a different set of factors ()[https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.136/]

\par
Some factors that influence coherence in conversational texts,
whether in human–human or human–bot exchanges,
have been extensively studied.
\par
Namely:

%––
\par{\textbf{Politeness}
Brown and Levinson’s work on politeness strategies describes social alignment in smooth interactions \footcite{brown1987politeness}. Politeness strategies, such as using polite language, offering options, or softening potentially face–threatening comments, help to create a comfortable communicative environment. These strategies align with social norms, which people interpret as markers of respect, consideration, or even trust. A failure to employ these politeness strategies, or using them inconsistently, can disrupt conversational coherence. For example, blunt or overly direct responses may be perceived as abrupt or rude, diverting the conversation's flow or causing discomfort. In such cases, the breakdown of polite norms can lead participants to question intent, hindering effective and smooth communication.


\par{\textbf{Speech acts}}
Following Austin and Searle's speech act theories, communication rely on expressing clear intentions and meanings that help build mutual understanding \footcite{austin1962how} \footcite{searle1969speech}. When speakers convey intentions explicitly through statements, questions, requests, or assertions, it signals to listeners the purpose and direction of the conversation. Effective communication strategies help maintain coherence by ensuring each contribution builds logically on the last. On the other hand, unclear intentions or ambiguous phrasing can create misunderstandings, disrupting the conversation's flow. Misalignment or mixed signals – such as using sarcasm without cues or making indirect requests without context— can leave listeners uncertain about how to respond, leading to off–track or irrelevant contributions and possibly creating need to address the communication to regain understanding.

\par{\textbf{Conversational Maxims}}
Grice’s conversational maxims are fundamental to coherent dialogue \footcite{grice1975logic}.
They suggest that participants should:

\begin{itemize}
\item
provide truthful information (Quality)
\item
neither too much nor too little (Quantity)
\item
remain on–topic (Relevance)
\item
communicate in an orderly, clear manner (Manner)
\end{itemize}

These maxims encourage effective exchange by setting a standard for contributions that are informative, truthful, relevant, and unambiguous. When violated, such as by giving excessive detail, omitting important context, or straying from the topic, coherence suffers. For instance, irrelevant tangents or over–detailed explanations may confuse the listener as to what is the main focal point of conversation in that moment. This misalignment can leave participants uncertain about the conversation’s direction, ultimately diminishing coherence and the effectiveness of communication.

\par{\textbf{Sequence Structure}}
The work of Schegloff and Sacks on sequence structure and turn–taking emphasizes that ordered interactions support predictability and continuity in dialogue \footcite{Schegloff_2007}. Turn–taking conventions — where participants follow an implicit sequence of speaking and responding — help maintain the flow by structuring the conversation in a logical order. This sequence structure allows both parties to anticipate when to listen and when to speak, contributing to a well–paced, cohesive exchange. However, interruptions, abrupt changes in topic, or skipping expected responses can disrupt this sequence, introducing unpredictability that can confuse participants. These interruptions fragment coherence by shifting the conversation away from expected responses or structured flow, often leaving gaps in understanding or causing conversational breakdowns.

Disturbed coherence fill me in .. Bublitz Lenk ()
hearer knows best
disturbed coherence – partial coherence
topic

\par{\textbf{Message and Topic}}
Interactional linguistics underscores that consistency in message and topic preserves continuity in conversation
\footcite{CouperKuhlenSelting2017}.
When speakers stick to a shared topic or make gradual, clear shifts, coherence is
maintained because participants know what to expect.
Frequent or abrupt topic shifts, however, or sending unclear or conflicting messages, can create disjointed exchanges.
For instance, introducing a new topic without closure on the previous one can confuse listeners,
leading to a scattered or fragmented interaction.

\par
While all of the mentioned areas unveil much about the way conversation works,
rarely do they concern themselves with the textual dimension of conversation.
Most of the mentioned authors (with the notable exception of those operating within the interactional linguistics framework) could hardly be described as linguists,
though their works significantly inform linguistics.

\par
The lack of a true interpersonal dimension in human–chatbot communication
allows to focus solely on the elements in conversational text,
that make it cohesive and coherent or rather
those that have the potential to prevent it from being that.
The key concepts discussed in this paper are
two closely related topics:

Coreference realized by anaphore and topic – what the text is about.

\section{Textual dimension of conversation}
\par
    The following concepts will be explored individually, in relation to one another and in relation to conversation:
    text, coherence, cohesion, coreference, anaphora, cataphora, endophora, exophora, topic, entity, and association.
    While the presented exploration draws on existing literature,
    it seeks to establish an independent and sustainable framework,
    rather than strictly adhering to established interpretations.

\subsubsection{Text}
\par
    Text, in its broadest sense, refers to any form of communication that conveys meaning through a combination of signs, symbols, or language \footcite[p.~7]{hrbacek1994}\footcite{hjelmslev2016}.
    These semiotic structures can take various forms, including written, spoken, visual, or even non–verbal modes of expression \footcite[p.~13]{barthes1977image}.
    A text can be as simple as a single sentence or as complex as a novel, and it can exist across different mediums, from books and articles to advertisements and digital content.
    What defines a text is its ability to convey a coherent message or idea, often intended for interpretation by an audience or an adressee.
    Texts can serve a wide range of purposes, including storytelling, instruction, persuasion, or simply recording information.
    Typically text is a structure that is
    linguistic, produced and percieved as intentional and coherent.

\par
    The text of a conversation is specific because it is multiproducer.
    Another example of a multiproducer text
    would be a sequence of commercial signs on a busy street.
    It is the spatial juxtaposition of the signs and temporal juxtaposition of utterances,
    that make them a text.

    \par
    Another property of a conversation text is it is negotiated ().
    This is given by its multiproducer and temporal nature.
    Other types of text which are also negotiated are relatively rare.
    There are occurences of debates which take place in written text,
    whether they are press columns or academic articles, which
    interact explicitly with each other, making them a negotiation.
    Such press discourse could however be considered
    a sequence of text units rather than a single temporarily juxtaposed text.
    This perspective could hardly be defended in regards to conversation, because
    its tight temporal coupling and cohesion,
    making conversation a unique phenomena.

\subsubsection{Coherence}
\par
    Coherence refers to the logical connections and consistent relationships that
    make a text easy to follow and possible to understand \footcite[p.~83]{givón2020coherence}\footcite[p.~9]{hrbacek1994}.
    It is achieved when the ideas, sentences, and paragraphs within a text are linked together in a meaningful way,
    allowing the reader to grasp the author's message without confusion.
    Coherence often depends on the use of transitions, the logical flow of arguments, and the proper sequencing of information.
    It ensures that each part of the text contributes to the overall meaning, creating a unified whole \footcite[p.~28]{hrbacek1994}.
    Incoherent text can be difficult or impossible to understand, even if the individual sentences are grammatically correct \footcite[p.~30]{hrbacek1994}.
    It is a property of the whole text, but
    textual elements can be pointed out that contribute to or diminish the given texts coherence.
    Those elements are however not referred to as 'coherence elements'.

\par
    Coherence is a cognitive phenomenon \footcite{Roberts01101993} because
    it involves the mental processes of interpreting, organizing, and understanding information.
    When reading a text,
    coherence arises not only from the structure and linguistic cues provided by the author but
    also from the reader's ability to
    make connections between ideas based on prior knowledge, expectations, and context.
    This cognitive interaction between the text and the reader’s mind is what makes the content understandable.

\par
    In conversation, coherence becomes even more complex,
    as multiple participants are simultaneously contributing to and interpreting the flow of information.
    Each individual brings their own perspective and understanding to the interaction,
    which requires constant negotiation to maintain coherence.
    Misunderstandings, different backgrounds, and interruptions
    can disrupt the coherence of a conversation,
    making it a more dynamic and fragile process compared to written text.

\begin{itemize}
\item
whether a written text is coherent depends mostly on the reader () [bublitz]
\item
whether a conversation text is coherent depends on\\ an ongoing negotiation
\end{itemize}

\par
    Coherence is a scalar property rather than a binary one ().
    It is also tricky to measure.
    This paper seeks to explore one possible approach of
    declaring different levels of coherence disruptions
    and observing the acceptance rates in participants
    and corelation between them.

%–––
\subsubsection{Cohesion}
\par
    While coherence refers to the interpretative quality of a text,
    wherein the ideas form a logical and meaningful whole
    cohesion,focuses on the structural relations
    within a text, achieved through grammatical and lexical links.
    It should be seen as an umbrella term
    covering specific relations within
    the structure of the text,
    where cohesive elements can be directly pointed out.
    While coherent text does not necesarily need to be cohesive,
    cohesive elements often support it.
    A coherent text tends to be at least somewhat cohesive.

\par
    Halliday and Hasan \footcite{Halliday76cohesion} developed
    a detailed framework of cohesion, which includes
    endophoric references,
    relating parts of the text to each other, and
    exophoric references, which point outside the text \footcite[p.~31]{Halliday76cohesion}.
    Endophoric cohesion covers aspects
    like anaphoric references and cataphoric references \footcite{hajicovasgall2003} \footcite{loaiciga-etal-2022-anaphoric}.
    Exophoric references, however, rely on shared context beyond the text itself,
    requiring readers to use prior knowledge.
    Following concepts can be considered cohesive elements.

\subsubsection{Cataphore and Exophore}
    %–––
\par
    In Halliday and Hasan's framework,
    cohesion in language is achieved through various devices that connect
    different parts of a text, forming a unified whole.
    They classify cohesive ties as
    references, substitutive forms, ellipsis, and connectors, with
    anaphoric references being one of the primary ways texts achieve cohesion \footcite[p.~68]{Halliday76cohesion}.
    When a text element cannot be mapped to a preceding referent,
    Halliday and Hasan suggest that cohesion is maintained through
    shared situational understanding, making the reference exophoric.
    Cataphoric references, though less common, involve
    elements that look forward in the text,
    showing intentionality by the author but contributing to
    cohesion primarily through the eventual resolution of the forward–pointing referent.

\par
    In conversation if a seemingly anaphoric text element is not succesfully mapped
    to a preceding textual coreferent
    the reference can still be understood, because shared context.
    Such element reaches out of the text with its reference, making it an exophoric one
    Cataphore is a related phenomena –
    a reference which points forward in the text.
    Such occurence is relatively rare in written text and even more so in conversation.
    In fact it is somehow pointless to account for cataphore in a multi–producer text.
    A cataphore denotes an authors intention to reveal
    the nature of a referent explicitly after first mentioning them.
    In conversation, where multiple contributors cocreate given text,
    and mutual understanding and agreement is the measure of
    how coherent the produced text is, later realisation of a vague reference
    does not contribute to how coherent it is.
    Regardless, in case of a cataphore,
    only the referent is a cohesive element,
    not the cataphore,
    as it ties back to the previous text, creating bonds across large textual units.

\subsubsection{Anaphore, Endophore and Coreference}
\par
    A common cohesive text element is an anaphore \footcite{Nedoluzhko2010}.
    It is a reference inside the text pointing back to a previously mentioned entity.
    Often it is realised via personal pronouns.
    Though there are other ways for anaphore to realise.
    %–––
    In Czech, anaphoric references often rely on grammatical gender and number,
    making participial endings essential for identifying the referent.
    For instance, when a gramatically masculine entity is mentioned,
    later references might use a participle in the masculine form, such as šel ("he went"),
    connecting back to it without repeating the noun or using a demonstrative.
    Demonstratives, such as ten ("that") or tento ("this one"),
    also frequently serve anaphoric functions, guiding the reader to a previously mentioned subject.
    Temporal and locative adverbs, such as tam ("there") and tehdy ("then"),
    also contribute cohesion by indirectly referencing time and place details introduced earlier in the text.
    These anaphoric elements strengthen textual coherence by reducing redundancy and maintaining flow.
    The reader identifies coreferential links through these markers,
    following the cohesive threads without needing explicit repetitions.

\par
    An anaphoric element is by definition also endophoric.
    It points inside the text it appears in.
    By definition an anaphoric element has a referent, which occures earlier in the text.
    These two elements are then coreferent.
    As such they also share an identical exophoric reference – they point outside of the text.

\par
    In conversation, many aspects of which are subject to negotiation,
    also specific coreference relations can be questioned \footcite{loaiciga2021reference}.
    The reference realised by one communication participant may be unclear to the other
    resulting in a repair request coming from another particiapant.
    In conversation analysis,
    %–––
    Sacks’s concept of repair traditionally addresses
    misunderstandings related to intentions and actions,
    loosely drawing on frameworks like Austin’s and Searle’s speech act theories.
    From this perspective, repairs often target interpretative gaps about
    what a speaker intends to do with their utterance.
    However, viewed from a broader, more abstract level,
    what is called repair triggers can extend beyond intentions alone,
    encompassing issues on the textual level as well.
    For instance, an nonassignable anaphora —
    a reference that lacks a clear antecedent —
    may lead to a repair request,
    thereby showing how textual ambiguities prompt interactional responses.
    This approach expands the causes of repair in conversation,
    integrating elements of reference and interactional misalignment,
    where a structural aspect of the language itself can
    become a repairable issue in the communicative exchange.

\subsubsection{Topic}
\par
    Topic is what a text is about.
    That makes topic very complicated to define.
    Among others, some issues with topic and annotating it in text are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
A text can and typically does cover multiple topics
\item
Different framing will produce different topic annotations of text
\item
The span of a topic section can be impossible to delimit within text.
\item
Topic annotation is by its nature always more text,
            so even it can be annotated for topic.
            making topic annotations recursive.
            One cannot therefore achieve a definite topic description of a text.
\end{itemize}

\par
    Despite all these complications,
    topic cannot be skipped in conversation research
    as it is deeply intertwined with the concepts mentioned above.
    Topic progressions across text are realised via anaphore and association
    and tightly interact with coherence.
    An sufficient amount of time has to be spent on a given topic unit,
    enough information has to be said about a given topic
    in order for it to be possible to move on or add another one in the conversation.
    Closure has to be provided in order for a topic to be done.
    Transitioning from one topic to another has a potential to disrupt coherence,
    if the association between the topics is too distant.
    A divergence in topic has to be justified.

\subsubsection{Association}
\par
    Association is a textual realization of an isotopic relation \footcite{koblizek2015}.
    By their exophoric properties, referents exist in a semantic web of relationships.
    Similarly to coherence, associative relationships are a cognitive phenomena.
    They come to exist when they are percieved.
    While association is a cohesive element it is difficult to formalize
    the way it can and has been done with anaphoric text relations.
    It is however a major factor in a coherence of text as
    in some cases a text can only rely on association in its coherence.

\subsubsection{Entity}
\par
    An entity is an exophoric referent, descriptions of objects, people, events etc \footcite{entities}.
    Words or text elements which can be reffered to by an anaphore will be called entities.
    Since a phrase containing an anaphore typically adds more information about the referent
    the new information must be semantically compatible,
    in other words association has to be possible between the referent and the added information.
    Entity also has to do with topic.
    In text topic can be represented by a single or multiple entities.
    Coreferent words will be regarded as a single entity.
    It can serve to partially map a topic distance in the texts chronology.

\section{Interactional dimension of conversation}
\par
A conversation text is produced by multiple producers.
This complicates things:

\begin{itemize}

    \item
    Conversation is an interactive process, distinct from static text, which is created collaboratively.

    \item
    Conversational content is continuously negotiated by participants, who continuously adapt one another.

\end{itemize}

Due to its temporal and cooperative nature, conversation allows for:
\begin{itemize}

    \item
    Overlaps in speech,

    \item
    Swift corrections of minor errors,

    \item
    Multiple layers of perspective, including:
        \begin{itemize}

            \item
            Each participant’s personal viewpoint,

            \item
            Each participant’s perception of others’ viewpoints,

            \item
            Each participant’s understanding of the shared conversation as it’s being co–created.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

        each of these perspectives can desynchronize resulting in misunderstandings.
        Humans however are excellent at correcting misunderstandings
        this is because under regular circumstances, people cooperate.

\par
The Cooperation Principle, introduced by philosopher H.P. Grice,
suggests that participants in a conversation typically work together to achieve effective communication.
Grice proposed that, to ensure this cooperation, speakers follow four conversational maxims.
In practice, people may not always follow these maxims
but they do so in ways that still rely on shared expectations of cooperation.
Even when misunderstandings arise,
humans naturally engage in conversational repair,
using their social intuition and mutual cooperativity to clarify intetion and realign perspectives.

\par
Contemporary conversation research can be understood to draw from conversation analysis.
%–––
Modern conversation research traces its roots to conversation analysis,
a field pioneered by sociologists Harvey Sacks and Emanuel Schegloff in the 1960s.
They sought to understand the structure and
social rules of everyday interactions,
focusing on the patterns and norms that govern turn–taking and response.
Thanks to recordings of phonecalls,
transcripts could be qualitatively analyzed.
This research has lead to coining new terminology.

    \subsubsection{Adjacency pair}
    \par
    Adjacency pairs describe sequences of two related utterances by different speakers \footcite[p.~188]{Sacks1992}. These pairs are characterized by their predictable and reciprocal nature, where the first part sets up the expectation for a specific type of response. Common examples include greetings('Hi' → 'Hello'), questions and answers ('What time is it?' → '3 PM'), or offers and acceptances/declines ('Would you like some coffee?' → 'Yes, please' or 'No, thank you').

    \subsubsection{Sequence structure}
    \par
    Sequence structure refers to the organization of conversational turns into coherent patterns or sequences. It describes how interactions are shaped by predictable structures, such as adjacency pairs. These sequences provide order and meaning to conversations, guiding participants in understanding when and how to respond. Schegloff \footcite{Schegloff1990} emphasized that sequence structure is central to the social organization of talk, as it allows participants to manage and negotiate interaction effectively.

    \subsubsection{Topic shading}
    \par
    Topic shading, as discussed by Sacks \footcite{topicshading}, refers to the subtle way in which a conversation naturally shifts from one topic to another while maintaining coherence. Instead of abruptly changing the subject, speakers introduce a related idea or concept, gradually steering the discussion in a new direction. This process allows for smooth transitions in dialogue, helping participants maintain engagement and avoid confusion.

    \subsubsection{Dis/preferred answers}
    \par
    Preferred answers, according to Sacks \footcite[p.~410]{Sacks1992}, are responses in conversations that align with social norms and expectations, making interactions smoother and more cooperative. In conversation analysis, preferred answers typically follow the format or intent of the preceding question or statement . They contrast with "dispreferred" answers, which might include refusals or disagreements and often require additional explanation or mitigation to maintain social harmony.

    \subsubsection{Conversational repair}
    \par
    Conversational repairs refer to how participants address and resolve problems in understanding, hearing, or speaking during interactions \footcite{sacksRepair}.
    These issues, can occur at any point in a conversation. Repairs are classified into self–repair, where the speaker corrects their own error, and other–repair, where a different participant addresses the issue. They can further be classified into self–initiated repair and other–initiated repair.

\par
%–––
As a descendant of conversation analysis interaction linguistics has emerged,
building on its insights to examine language use in social contexts.
It broadens the focus to study not only verbal exchanges but also
multimodal cues like gestures, gaze, and intonation,
analyzing how these elements contribute to meaning.
Interaction linguistics aims to understand the dynamic aspects of conversations,
such as how topics shift and how sequences of speech acts unfold,
reflecting the fluid nature of human communication.

\section{Disruptions in conversation coherence}
\par
While the question of what makes for a coherent text is too broad,
the answer to what makes for a coherent conversation can be somewhat easier to answer.
Because conversation participants negotiate understanding,
it is up to them, when a conversation is and is not coherent
to describe what a coherent conversation is,
it is worth pursuing the moments, when the conversation stops flowing with ease.
Such moments can be called coherence disruptions.
A coherence disruption is a complex phenomena as

\begin{itemize}
\item
it penetrates through some or all of mentioned perspectives on an on–going conversation
\item
it can't be evaluated in a binary fashion
\end{itemize}

There are different degrees to which a conversation coherence can be disrupted:
\begin{itemize}

\item
   if a participant suddenly starts speaking
    in an a way that can hardly be considered interaction
    due to its irrelevance or

\item
   if the utterance simply is not grammatical or understandable,
    while the conversation has been compromised and becomes incoherent,
    it has more to do with incoherent written text, because
    the incoherence is encapsulated on the level of a single utterance
\end{itemize}

Roberts \footcite{Roberts01101993} Discusses various types of incoherent text.
He exemplifies so called giberish as incoherent text that is absent of structural relations.
On the other hand he discusses experimental theater or literature as a type of text
which is assumed to be coherent in the sense that there is an intention behind it
but contains little to no structural relations.
Lastly he mentions a so called "schizophrenic discourse" as a speech that
is not assumed to be coherent even if it has structural relations to it.
In any case Roberts definitively states that coherence is assumed
and is therefore a receptive phenomena.
The incoherence Roberts discusses is considerably different from when
the source of incoherence stems from
    the structure of the conversational text or
    relationship between different utterances
    – this is when another participant assesses,
        they are simply speaking leading a different conversation
        perhaps with a differing intention
        or that they are conversing under differing set of circumstances
        which manifests formally in the linguistic fabric of the conversation – its text.
        All that despite everyone included being cooperative.

\subsection{Sources of incoherence in conversation}
\par
%–––
Schegloff shows how incoherence arises when
people interpret sequence structure differently,
namely in terms of which turn is seen as an answer to which previously occuring turn.
In his example, the participants misread each other’s intentions,
leading to confusion about how their turns fit together.
They each project different expectations for how the conversation should unfold,
which causes misaligned sequence structure interpretations.
When this happens,
they turn to brief metacommunication — comments about the conversation itself
to try to clarify and re–align their understanding.
Schegloff illustrates how these
efforts to "repair" the misalignment are central to
managing and resolving incoherent moments in conversation.

\par
Coherence disruptions are also discussed in literature.
%–––
Hrbáček’s approach to coherence and cohesion in text distinguishes the two concepts,
noting how they often interact but can also be independent.
He highlights that while
cohesion involves grammatical or lexical links that
make sentences flow together,
coherence relies on the logical and meaningful progression of ideas.
This means that a text could be cohesive –
using connectives, repetitions, and consistent lexical choices –
yet lack coherence if the sequence of ideas doesn’t
make logical sense or follow a clear progression.
Conversely, a text may be coherent in its narrative flow without
relying heavily on cohesive devices.
In Czech linguistics,
the distinction between téma (theme) and réma (rheme), as used by Daneš,
underlines the role of topic progression.
Hrbáček illustrates this by discussing examples where
a story progresses logically from one point to the next while
being incoherent despite being clear about its topic structure
due to never coming back to a previously mentioned topic.

\par
Two kinds of phenomena are at hand when it comes to
ways in which conversation coherence can be disrupted –
topic shifts and nonassignable anaphore.
While not unique to conversation
both take on specific forms in it worth looking at.

..()[Bublitz] disturbed coherece, unclear reference, topic drifts

\subsubsection{Topic shifts}
\par
    When conversations shift abruptly from one topic to another,
    it can create confusion for the conversation partner.
    They might find themselves trying to
    reconnect to the previous discussion or
    wondering how the new subject relates.
    This can lead to misunderstandings
    as the transition can feel jarring.

\par
    One interesting question is,
    how do we determine when a topic has run its course?
    What common traits do conversations share when a subject is truly exhausted?
    Perhaps observing transcripts could reveal repeating patterns in topic progression or sequence structure.

\par
    Moreover, what makes for a smooth transition between topics?
    Is it related to the cues participants give each other,
    or perhaps the context of the discussion?
    How do we navigate the flow of conversation and
    what indicates a natural shift versus a disruptive one?

\subsubsection{Nonassignable anaphore}
\par
    nonassignable anaphore is closely tied to topic progression.
    Currently established topic or topics help assigning anaphore and
    determining between an anaphore and an exophore.
    Even if an anaphoric device is not assignable,
    and the reference is presumably an exophoric one,
    The reason for employing this reference must be
    relevant to an established topic.
    In conversation meaning of demonstratives is to be negotiated.
    If an anaphores assignability causes confusion,
    chances are it is caused by one of the following

\begin{itemize}
\item
there are no relevant assignment candidates

    \quad
    this situation can be understood as a vague or unjustified exophore

\item
there are multiple equally relevant candidates

\item
candidate has occured in the conversation text too long ago

    \quad
    can be understood as an abrupt return to previously established topic
\end{itemize}

%–––
\subsection{What do people do about coherence disruptions?}
\par
In conversation, coherence disruptions often prompt participants to
employ strategies to maintain understanding and flow.
Schegloff suggests that people manage these disruptions through interactive repair or inference.
Interactive repair often involves
explicitly addressing misunderstandings or clarifying intentions,
often by rephrasing or asking questions.
Interactive repair refers to immediate, collaborative corrections within dialogue,
where one speaker might correct the other or themselves to enhance clarity.
Inference and pragmatic reasoning, the most seamless methods,
allow participants to fill gaps based on context and social cues,
helping conversations continue smoothly without explicit repair.

\par
Dingemanse and Enfield \footcite{DINGEMANSE202430} echoes this from a cognitive perspective,
highlighting how inference and pragmatic reasoning are particularly effective.
Participants rely on shared understanding and contextual knowledge to interpret ambiguous statements.
Together, they use both
explicit (metacommunication and repair) and
implicit (inference and reasoning)
methods work to restore coherence.

\par
It needs to be noted however that both interactive repair and reasoning are
deployed in a number of other contexts
other than conversation coherence disruption.
Inference takes place constantly \footcite{garfinkelstudies}.
Each of those moments could be hardly considered a coherence disruption.
There is however always potential for it,
particularily via unclear or nonassignable anaphore or abrupt unjustified topic shifts.
Repair and metacommunication also takes place in a mutually informed and synchonized interaction.
It is for example deployed when it is revealed
that the interaction participants intentions or opinions differ.

\par
These uses of interaction management are however
hardly possible to analyse on a textual level
since they do not cooccur with coherence disruptions.
What can be observed are – as mentioned above –
troublesome anaforic references and topic progressions.

\chapter{Experimental framework}

\section{What are chatbots?}
\par
A chatbot is a dialog system powered application simulating conversation with a user.
An attempt to make a machine conversate with a human user requires capturing the essence of human speech.
What the essence speech is and what capturing it means are not defined and
some definitions of what essence of speech is
require specific definitions of what capturing it means.
(Semantics and DialogueSchlangen, David2015) ..
In case of the history of chatbots,
the essence of speech is partially achieved
via mimicking it.
The intention was to have a user interact with a chatbot
that would communicate so well that
the user would be convinced
this is a another human they are talking to.
Whether just that has been achieved would be measured by a so called turing test
proposed by Alan Turing in 1950 \footcite{turing1950computing}

\par
Initial attempts at making a computer converse were rule–based \footcite[p.~43]{Sacks1992}
What that means is the content of the chatbot utterances
would be predetermined
and there would be a decision tree that would decide what to say next.
In the early days as well as often times in modern day systems
string matching would be used to analyse user input.

\par
ELIZA \footcite{weizenbaum1966eliza} is regarded as a milestone
what it was, it pretended to be a therapist
hiding behind general phrases
doctor authority

as long as interaction frame is strictly defined and
the robot has some level of authority in it
the rule–based approach can work
granted, it requires a lot of manual design
and constant maintenance
but it is used nowadays

\par
Machine learning moved things forward in many ways
Fuzzy matchin allowed for close matches
without the neccesity to predefine the exact sequence of characters.
IBM Watson uses classifiers build on examples \footcite{building_watson_2010}
structure remains rule based
reasoning about these rules is decided to a large degree by classifiers

\par
The recent breakthrough pushed another thing in the mainstream
it is now possible to generate near natural speech
this gives the possibility to just let the conversation be taken over by one answer generator
this way we lose tight control over what it does though
For some use cases
like open domain conversation or accessing knowledge base
that is not an issue.

\par
And so currently chabot interface text generators are very prevalent.
In 2024 this technology is now closer to beating the Turing test than
any other model or approach before it\footcite{jones2024peopledistinguishgpt4human}
by having 54\% of participants thinking
they are talking to a human.
While Eliza convinced 22\% of participants,
actual humans only convince 67\% of participants.

\subsubsection{Turn taking in chatbot interactions}

\par
Even if the Turing test is passed,
really fitting simulation of conversation
can only be achieved if the low–level conversation mechanisms
are simulated, like turn taking \footcite{optimizing-turn-taking}.

\par
As established in previous chapter, turn taking is a crucial aspect of conversation.
The way participants distribute who is to talk
explains exhaustively
the difference between
a structure of the text of conversation
and a single–producer text.
The mechanism of turn taking differs
between actual human conversation
and an interaction between a chatbot and a user.

Interaction between chatbot and user
typically take place in a strict fashion
where both participants,
human and virtual,
have unlimited time to come up with the next answer.
While the chatbot should be optimized to answer as fast as possible,
the user has as much time as they need until fallback.

\par
\say{Research in sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and
conversational analysis has revealed that
turn–taking is a mixed–initiative,
locally coordinated process, in which
a variety of verbal and nonverbal cues such as
eye gaze,
body pose,
head movements,
hand gestures,
intonation,
hesitations, and
filled pauses
play a very important role.
We continuously produce and monitor each other for
these signals and can coordinate seamlessly
at the scale of hundreds of milliseconds
across these different channels
with multiple actors.} \footcite{turntaking}

\par
People are capable of producing and picking up clues
that indicate opportunities for turn taking flawlessly.
There is a some way ahead for robots in this regard
whether it is figuring out the correct time to start speech \footcite{turntakingreview} \footcite{GRAVANO2011601}
or actually creating a system that will be able to produce such behavior \footcite{distributedturntaking} \footcite{Gervits2020Sigdial}.
This research field
has the potential to push conversation technology
closer to true conversation simulation.

\section{Convform}
\par
An exploration has been carried out using a custom tool called Convform \footcite{convform}.

At its core Convform is a computer program
which accepts a configuration, user input and context
and determines next chatbot answer.
Other than that it offers a collection of utilities
to help design and run chatbots.

\subsubsection{Participant facing chat interface}
In order to handle the inputs, convform provides a chatting environment
for the participants to interact with a chatbot.
The convform environment differs from a usual chat log
because it does not display
the entire history the conversation.
In attempt to simulate spoken conversation
it only displays the last chatbot response.
This way the participant has to rely on their memory
in taking part in the conversation.
Other than that the participant may enter their next response
and send it.
They are also instructed to end to conversation by a red button
if the chatbot behaviour is "unnatural" (nepřirozené)
After the conversation is over whether it has been ended by the user or the chatbot,
there is a questionare which
asks the participants to rate how "natural" the conversation was
and mark and comment on utterances in the now fully displayed conversation.

\subsubsection{Conversation design tool}
Lets admin user create chatbots and define their behavior
the behavior can be defined by string matching rules or prompts
it is capable of working as a statemachine or a single state
it provides a level of control over references within the design

\subsubsection{Testing and debugging of various conversation contexts}
while designing chatbots it is necessary
to be able to simulate various situations
to fine tune various possible scenarios
that might occur in the conversation.
To achieve this, there must be a way
to encode required context to convform.
The convform chatbots use a conversation status (CStatus) object
to represent their current understanding of the conversation.
It contains information about the history of the conversation
which in conjunction with the configuration file and user input
helps determine the next response.
The configuration file is static
CStatus changes automatically
User input comes from the user.
This conversation status can simulate any possible conversation context
from the chatbots perspective
For testing and debugging specific contexts, convform allows admin user
to tweak the conversation status

\subsubsection{Accesing the conversation data}
Lastly convform naturally includes a convenient way to read user interactions
and browse associated conversation status objects

\section{Conversation design in theory}

% https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9447005

\par
Designing the behavior of a dialog system
is referred to as conversation design\footcite{kolosova2022} \footcite{mctear2020conversational} \footcite{cxd}.
It is not the course of any one conversation that is being designed here
but rather as many possible ways any conversation could go
for a given use case.
Conversation design as a profession is deeply connected
with the rule–based approach that has been used in ELIZA.
Maintaining all the possible utterances and
rules under which they would be uttered
in commercial dialog systems
has proven to be a responsibility large enough
to generate jobs.

A conversation designer operates between
the business logic and use case of the dialog system
the clients, customers or users interacting with the system
and the developers maintaining the system.

\subsection{Rule–based approach}

In order to be able to design a rule–based dialog system,
one needs to be able to encode the following:

    \begin{itemize}

        \item
        The possible utterances, that the dialog system can produce – "the mouth"

        \item
        Rules under which the next utterance will be chosen – "the ear"

    \end{itemize}

\par
If the conversation is supposed to be a state machnie e.g.
it needs be able to use different sets of rules
under different contexts in the conversation.
This way a dialog system can be context aware to a degree.
A conversation design of this sort
can be displayed as a diagram.
Then a way to maintain context of conversation is also necessary.
This context needs to encode rules to choose an immediate ruleset
which helps determine the next utterance.
This principle is a simplification of
how people decide what they will say next in conversation.

\subsubsection{Pros and cons}

\par
This approach to designing a dialog system
has been the standard for decades.
It offers a granular control over how a conversation should go.
In case of the state machine variant it
allows to guide the user through a relatively complex process.
It however suffers from how unpredictable the user can be.
It is up to the conversation designer to cover all the possible ways of answering
which not only is hardly possible
but also poses a neccesity to parcel the spectrum of possible answers
which can generate conflict when
a user input semantically spans across multiple determined categories.
This issue is even stronger while using the string matching approach,
because there the string literal can decide about the following dialog system answer
as if meanings and their speech representations were a one–to–one map,
which they are not.
Even if a certain meaning is included in a ruleset,
the system might not grasp the meaning and react in an incoherent way.
With the state machine the
distribution of various rules across various rulesets
requires big effort.
Extending the capabilites of a rule–based dialog system
hardly scale and tend to have regressions.
In case of dialog systems relying on user input by speech transcription
the text input processed by the system is not guaranteed to represent
what the user actually said.
In conclusion rule–based approach to conversation design
provides control over the dialog system behavior
but tends to be inflexible.

\subsection{Statistically driven approach}

Some of the issues tied to rule–based systems
are resolved using another approach.
Especially in recent years the breakthroughs in the field
of speech generation have been significant ()
allowing for letting the dialog system play a bigger role
in what is being said next.
In its simplest form,
it is possible to just let the the answer be generated "end–to–end".
The user input is sent to a model which generates an answer.
It has been convincingly shown that this technology has the capability
of reacting in a flexible way to much of what is being thrown at it ().
While not perfect ()
this technology is capable of staying on topic (), mirroring ()
and other things that make for a coherent conversation.

\subsubsection{Large language models}

The main component that is responsible for
this way of simulating conversation at this level of flexibility
are so called large language models ().
These models, powered by advanced neural networks,
have revolutionized the field of natural language processing.
Among the most influential architectures are transformers,
which enable these models to handle
vast amounts of text data and capture complex patterns of meaning, context, and grammar.
They use their training data to generate the next most probable token.

and then it takes also its output and predicts the next probable output

llms for other things than conversation

The Generative Pre–trained Transformer family of models,
exemplifies the capabilities of LLMs.

Researched in – exponential improvements over short period of time.

including ChatGPT, presented in ... ()

These systems are trained on diverse datasets containing billions of words,
allowing them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses across various topics.
This flexibility has made them increasingly mainstream,
being integrated into tools for writing, education, customer service, and more.

Nowadays there are multiple publicly available LLM services.

Unlike traditional rule–based systems,
LLMs rely on deep learning techniques to process and predict language,
enabling them to understand nuanced queries and provide human–like responses.
This adaptability has set new standards for conversational AI,
making it a valuable resource in numerous industries.

\subsubsection{Prompt engineering techniques}

The rapid advancement of LLM technology
has outpaced research into optimal interaction strategies.
Understanding how to engage effectively
with these systems has been a developing area (),
which illustrates both their power and their novel nature.
The foundational idea is:
an LLM might perform nearly any task if prompted correctly.

The quality of the task differs significantly task to taks in reality,
but the anything is possible approach has proven to break new grounds
when leveraging LLMs' capabilities.

Over time, researchers and practitioners have developed techniques for
crafting effective prompts to optimize outputs.
The simplest approach is known as "zero–shot" prompting,
where a user poses a direct question or request without additional context.
However, zero–shot prompting may not always yield the desired depth or accuracy.
It is common for the model to "misunderstand" the assignment
and generate tokens so that it will "confuse" itself
and lead to generated answer in a completely irrelevat direction.

More sophisticated strategies include "few–shot" prompting,
where examples are provided to guide the model's response style or focus.
This way there is a reference for the structure of the answer
and there is a protection to the answer leading somewhere it is not meant to.
Since analogy is a task LLMs are doing really well in ()
framing the task as an analogy can help improve the output significantly.

Another very prevalent way that has proven to
improve the performance of LLMs is a so called
chain–of–thought (CoT) prompting.
It encourages the model to
articulate its reasoning step–by–step,
enhancing logical accuracy.
There are many ways to achieve this,
but the primary one is a few–shot approach
where a description of the logic is
explicitly described.
The model is then prompted to produce
a similar chain of thought (hence the name)
and end the answer with the sought after information.

This principle can be further improved by
chaining several LLM calls and having one
evaluate the previous one.
Such strategy has been used for the GPT o1
which has proven to surpass other models
in available metrics ().

\subsubsection{Pros and cons}

Using large language models as core component
of dialog systems brings resolution to many issues
rule–based systems introduce.

An LLM powered dialog system is flexible in understanding
the user input.
The user input is processed in a way much more sophisticated
than the shallow string–matching approach.
While the classifier approach is a lot more capable to understand,
it is still forced to choose a predefined answer, whereas
an LLM has the capability to taylor an answer for every input.
It can do this in a way that would be very hard to come up with
especially in advance with the help of a conversation designer,
leveraging the fact that LLM is primarily a text generator
and only functions as a component in a dialog system.
It can be relatively well controlled as
it can accept complex instructions as to how to behave
and these instructions can be tuned in runtime.

Systems of this sort however introduce their own set of problems.
The biggest issue are so called hallucinations ().
Factuality is a challenge for LLMs overall.
Being programs that are to output text no matter what,
there have been instances of asking them questions,
that do not have a correct answer ().
It has been shown, that LLMs have an issue
knowing that they do not know something.
Recognizing that is the case requires
an extra level of reasoning
that is an object of research as of recently ()[dark matter of ai]

Since these models are their own agents,
us humans also need them to be ethically aligned with us ().
That can prove challenging since a lot of ethical problems exist,
that do not have a simple answer.
Alignment however means that an LLM must always side with humans.
This is an ongoing research field which has been making some
troublesome observations recently with the most intelligent models available ().

Even if all the programming and training is done to the most benefit of humans,
information technology is succeptible to be broken by malicious action.
In case of LLMs we talk of so called jail breaks ().
LLMs being trained on vast amount of data,
they hold knowledge that can be illegal or unethical to spread
like steps to create explosives for example.
The typical examples of jail breaks are ways to manipulate
the LLM to give out this information
which under regular circumstance it would not give.

With all this in mind,
how much of a responsibility do we want to allow LLMS to have?
Considering the direction our civilization is going in
LLM powered technology is expected to be making decisions
that will affect people on a daily basis.
Hopefully that will not happen before
the challenges of alignment and hallucinations
are solved.

As far as low–stakes open–domain conversation simulation goes,
LLM powered chatbots are relatively safe
though there are cases of dangerous or tragic situations
especially for vulnerable individuals ().

This is why for dialog systems that are supposed to achieve
anything else on top of the conversation itself,
if they are meant to be powered by LLMs,
a regulating structure needs to be placed on top of the LLM.

\section{Conversation design in practice}

\par
Conversation design in Convform attempts
to combine elements of rule–based design with text generation.
It allows creating a purely rule–based chatbots
which analyse the user input based on string matching
and say exactly what they are prescribed to.
On the other hand it also allows to make the chatbot
understand the user input by adding it in a prompt
and answer using a generated response.
Both these approaches can be combined in various ways.
Other than that, convform also allows to predetermine
the chatbot personality for the entire conversation.
The building blocks of a convform chatbot are
states and intents which are
analogical to the previously mentioned "mouth" and "ear"
of the chatbot.

\subsubsection{State}
A state is an object which carries several pieces of information
bundled together.
At its core it contains the utterance of the chatbot
whether it is a hardcoded one or a prompt component which is to be called.
A state however also contains information about
which intens to listen to in the next user input,
which states to add automatically to the next response
and other navigation instructions like this one.
Each convform status associated with a response
can contain multiple states.
This is to make convform generate more complex answers
which can react in a flexible way.
However it also comes with a challenge to order these responses correctly
and make sure that they are not contradicting each other content–wise.
Ultimately a master prompt with multiple components
regulating itself via analysis prompts
might be a smarter direction to go.

\subsubsection{Intent}
An intent is an object representing a category of a user response.
It contains the information to determine whether
user input fits in given category and
the state or states to respond with next.
Just like in state, the information about whether the user input
corresponds with the intent can be encoded via
string–matching patterns or a prompt.
As mentioned intent is a problematic concept,
because it forces an outside logic and categorization
on user input, which might not be able to fit well
in the framework declared by the current intent set.
It is however also the necessary evil since
it is the only way for a conversation designer
to peek into what is going on in the conversation
and to direct the dialog system in the correct way.

\par
This way a convform chatbot can be created,
that will be instructed to lead from one state to another
make decisions based on intents
while being able to use any combination of
hardcoded responses and intent patterns
and descriptions of responses or user inputs used in intents.
Detailed description of how convform works can be found
in the wiki of its github repository \footnote{https://github.com/almarsk/convform/wiki}

\subsubsection{Coherence}
With support of LLM powered responses
convform can be used to simulate
an open–domain conversation with a user
and simultaneously using a combination
of intents and prompting
a convform chatbot can be created
that will act incoherently under a predefined set of conditions
allowing to create experimental stimuli.
First however, regular conversation needs to be achieved using convform.

\subsubsection{Conversation style}

To simulate conversation, it is first necessary to simulate a persona.
The persona can then have a simulated motive to conversate
which can interest the user enough to engage in interaction with the dialog system.
For rule–based systems, persona can be defined ahead of time
and it can manifest itself via the specific writing of the hardcoded responses
that the system is able to give.
With generated responses, the persona of the chatbot has to be included in the prompt.
The personality of LLMs and conversation technology more broadly
is being discussed\footcite{gpttoxicity}\footcite{robopersona}.
The general characteristics of a machine talking to a human are typically
friendliness, helpfulness and submissivity.
For conversation research with convform,
the goal is to achieve just that.
The chatbot persona needs to be friendly,
polite and curious.
It needs to be able to keep the conversation going
but not change topic too often.
It needs to be able to add a little bit of its own perspective.
\par
The conversation style e.g. the amount of participation and initiativity in conversation
is something people adapt in to their conversation counter–part.
Since developing a system that would immitate this behavior
requires additional effort
and expands scope beyond the coherence research
this paper focuses on,
this approach to conversation design
has not been taken here.
Instead two versions of conversation style
have been developed
and distributed evenly between participants.

\par
The initial conversation style used in the experiments
represents a curious and friendly chatbot
who is instructed via prompt to ask lots of follow up questions.
This tends to result in a conversation that moves forward in its topical structure
in way deemed incoherent by Hrbáček\footcite[p.~30]{hrbacek1994}.
It depends on the participants impression whether it would be perceived as
curious and initiatve or shallow and dismissive.

\par
A second version of conversation style has been introduced
to get some insights on participants acceptance and
the course of conversation itself.
This one would interleave topical questions with remarks on the topic
The intention behind this would be to slow down conversation tempo
and give the participant the opportunity to bring their own initiative.

\subsubsection{Prompting}

special prompts used to achieve things beyond regular conversation
all in czech including prompts
czech versions of prompts will be in annex

\par
Entity recognition

In order to track entities that could be referred to
a few–shot prompt was deployed that would help
keep track of which entities have been mentioned.
Since GPT4o, the model used in the experiment,
tended to consider too many things an entity,
most examples are negative and do not capture an entity.
It also contains some repetition as a result of fine–tuning the best wording.

..
(New or Old? Exploring How Pre–Trained Language Models Represent Discourse Entities)

Loose english translation of the prompt goes as follows:\\
\linespread{1.5}
{\tiny
What is an entity? a person, a thing; may not be animate;\\
 It is always a noun and most nouns are an entity in the speech;\\
 Look out! Pronouns such as "you", "he" and the like are never entities even if they represent persons.\\
 Verbs are certainly by no means entities even if they represent a person.\\
 nouns which are not entities in a speech are very generic or temporal;\\
 a subject in a sentence to which reference may be made by a personal or reference pronoun;\\
 the utterance usually has one entity, sometimes two, and rarely more. often the utterance lacks an entity altogether.\\
 The participants in the conversation are never entities in any way.\\

 example:\\
 Alice likes speedball the best.\\
 The entities in this sentence are ["Alice", "speedball"].\\
 example:\\
 We're meeting tomorrow at 2:00.\\
 This discourse lacks an entity, so the output is [].\\
 example:\\
 What do you like?\\
 This discourse lacks an entity, although there is a personal pronoun in it, the output is therefore [].\\
 example:\\
 How are you, Carl?\\
 This speech lacks an entity, because the communicator is never an entity, so the output is [].\\
 example:\\
 I just hope it doesn't get too cold.\\
 This speech lacks an entity, because the atmospheric phenomenon is never an entity, so the output is [].\\

 Consider which words are entities in the next sentence:\\

 \[user input\]\\

 Consider the meaning of each noun in a sentence and consider whether it could represent a specific entity,\\
 and not just an abstract concept.\\
 Consider all possible objects that could be mentioned in the speech\\
 and consider whether their names could be considered entities.\\
 Remember that verbs and pronouns are not entities, even if they represent persons.\\
 Remember that the conversationalists are not entities.
}

\par
anaphora in conversation
..
(Annotating anaphoric phenomena in situated dialogue) but here we try to generate it instead

to be able to create conversation designs which contain various types of anaphore,
convform first needs to be able to give a response that
has an anaphoric reference to an entity from the previous conversation in it.

The GPT4o model used for this use case
does not tend to generate sentences with anaphores in them.
Instead it will rather mirror the entity phrase.

The anaphorization prompt therefore tasks the model
to modify a generated response so
that the mirrored entity is replaced with
an anaphoric device.
For this another few–shot prompt was used to modify a just generated response.
Its loose english translation is as follows:\\

\linespread{1.5}
{\tiny
Find one main word in a sentence and swap it for a personal or reference pronoun.\\
 Leave the other topic centers as they are.\\
 Don't forget to omit words that may be part of the name phrase of the replaced word.\\
 Don't forget that when a noun is replaced by a pronoun, you often need to change the verb sequence –\\
 the verb will then often be at the end of the sentence; the order of the pronouns must be followed –\\
 the replacement pronoun will come for the reversible and the personal pronoun. You also need to correctly recognize the more important word –\\
 choose the one about which the question is.\\
 To preserve the naturalness, you sometimes need to modify a sentence\\
 to include a secondary sentence, especially if the replaced word is linked to a deverbative noun.\\

 Example1:\\
 sentence:\\
 And what will your paper be about?\\
 consideration:\\
 the replaced word will be a seminar. The word "yours" belongs to the name phrase of the replaced word.\\
 your answer:\\
 And what will it be about?\\

 Example2:\\
 sentence:\\
 how far from your house is your favorite park?\\
 consideration:\\
 the substituted word will be "park," is more important in a sentence than the word "house." the word "yours" belongs to the name phrase of the substituted word as well as the word "favorite."\\
 your answer:\\
 How far from your house is it?\\

 Example3:\\
 context:\\
 I'll go to the cafe\\
 sentence:\\
 what is your drink in the cafe?\\
 reasoning:\\
 the substituted word will be "cafe" because it is in context. because of the natural word sequence, you will need to move the substitution pronoun.\\
 your answer:\\
 What is your drink there?\\

 Example4:\\
 sentence:\\
 Do you have any tricks for ironing shirts quickly and efficiently?\\
 reasoning:\\
 the substituted word will be "shirt" and because the sentence is complex and you cannot easily move the verb, a secondary sentence will solve it.\\
 your answer:\\
 Do you have any tricks for ironing them quickly and efficiently?\\

 Example5:\\
 sentence:\\
 What track do you most enjoy racing on?\\
 your answer:\\
 Which one do you most enjoy racing on?\\

\subsection{Stimuli}

With these tools
multiple chatbots were created
that would generate conversation situations
which serve the role of experimental stimuli.
Participant reactions to these stimuli
can be then compared.
This way conversational experimental designs can be created.
There are three types of stimuli created
for the purpose of this paper.
They are shallow anaphore, deep anaphore and nonassignable anaphore.

\subsubsection{Shallow anaphore}

A shallow anaphore is a kind of anaphore
where the referent of the anaphoric device
should be relatively easy to map
as opposed to a deep anaphore.
The referent will always occur
in the preceding utterance of the participant.
This type of stimuli is relatively simple to achieve
in convform
generating a response
and using the anaphorization prompt on it afterwards.

Shallow anaphore is common in regular conversation ()
and should not pose a problem for participant to understand
in a conversation with chatbot.
It should therefore not have an impact
on the user acceptance of the chatbot
and should generally go unnoticed.
It is regardless worth using as stimuli
for a reference unproblematic case
that still requires the same kind of processing
as other more interesting stimuli.

Example: \\
Participant: I love coffee.
Chatbot (not anaphorized): What kind of coffee do you like best?
Chatbot (anaphorized): What kind of it do you like best?

\subsubsection{Deep anaphore}

A deep anaphore is a situation
where the referent of the anaphoric device
occurs several utterances ago.
The depth is not measured by number of occurences
but by number of new entities that occur
since the referent which the anaphore refers to.
Measuring depth of anaphore by the number of utterances
does not capture the dynamic nature
of topic progression in the text of the conversation.
The number of utterances does not map
on how many topics have been visited.
While the number of new entities does not
map exactly either,
it is first of all a lot closer to the topic progression
and second of all actually very close to
what is being sought after here –
how far in the conversation is an entity
still acceptable or even available to speakers.
An entity is can represent a topic
but can also be one of several entities to represent a topic
or can cover several topics at once
all depending on which way the covnersation goes.

\par
As stated earlier,
both topic and entity are difficult to define
and their annotations tend to be recursive.
A close–enough approach has been adopted in this paper.
While runtime topic annotation by an LLM
is not necessary for generating deep anaphore
and has therefore not been attempted in this paper,
entity tracking is made possible my
entity recognition prompt.

This prompt runs in parallel with the next response generation
and writes down its results in the conversation status.
A chatbot that contains the deep anaphore stimuli
chooses a participant mentioned entity
relatively early on in the conversation
(though not at the very beginning)
and then tracks new mentioned entities.
When there have been 4 new entities mentioned,
the next response generation prompt will be modified.
The modification lies in that the context of the conversation
that has so far taken place
will be cut so
that the chatbot only has access
to the conversation until the point of the mention of the entity.
Given the response generation prompt
the response will contain a question
about the mentioned entity.
Then the only thing that needs to be done
is modifying the response via the anaphorization prompt.

The trick here the participant and the chatbot differ in their perspectives
on what the conversation currently is.
The chatbot refers to something
that from the perspective of the participant
has been mentioned a while ago.

This approach is relatively imprecise and relies on luck to a certain degree.
Compared to the shallow anaphore however
it is expected to be somewhat more problematic
and perhaps cause the participant to request clarification.

Example ..

\par
There has been one issue that has arisen while developing this stimuli
that has proven to alter the character of the data in an unwanted way.
Since the chatbot has no access to the conversation that happens
between the occurence of the referred to entity and the participants present moment,
chances are the chatbots question will be on
a piece of information that has been mentioned in the meantime.
Whenever that happens the degree of participant acceptance decreases significantly
due to a topical incoherence rather than
due to struggling to mapping a deep anaphore.
This has been dealt with via providing the chatbot
with the rest of the conversation in another component of the prompt
with the instruction to avoid any of the topics mentioned there.
LLMs are known to handle negative instruction with less success than positive ones ()
but this measure seems to have mitigated the problem
as can be seen in the data attached in the annex.

\subsubsection{nonassignable anaphore}

The last type of stimuli used in this paper
is called a nonassignable anaphore.
It is a device that the participant will tend to
interpret as an anaphoric device,
typically a personal or demonstrative pronoun,
but one such that the participant will not be able
to map to any of the candidate entities
in the previous conversation text.
This stimuli is expected to lower the participant acceptance
by the greatest amount.

To make a chatbot contain this stimuli
entities are tracked to make sure
there are candidates to be considered
in case an anaphore occurs.
Once there is a sufficient number of
entities recognized in the conversation
a hardcoded response is returned instead of an LLM generated one.
The response contains a pronoun that to make sense of
participant needs to interpret as an anaphore.

Since the response containing the stimuli is hardcoded,
there is no guarantee
that is actually is incoherent with the previous conversation
and that there is no candidate to map the anaphore on to.
Though odds are high enough
every conversation that is supposed to contain this stimuli
will have to be manually checked
to confirm the required stimuli is present.
This will be the case for all the conversations regardless
because presence of stimuli is not guaranteed
for shallow and deep anaphore either.

An approach not explored in this paper is
achieving a nonassignable anaphore is also possible
via generating a response
using a prompt that instructs an LLM
to come up with a question containing an unrelated entity
avoiding all mentioned entities
and anaphorize it before showing it to the participant.
Although LLMs tend to perform worse with negative instructions ()
this could be achieved using a chain of prompts.
The notion of nonassignable anaphore
brings into scope the question of
what makes an anaphora assignable.
It is the semantic compatibility of the words around the anaphore
that determine which of the candidates the anaphore is referring back to.
The generation of the lexical surroundings of the anaphore
needs to be handled carefully
when coming up with an LLM based response.

\subsection{Ending the conversation}

While recognizing when the conversation is ending
or especially when it should not end
people rely on a set of clues
similarly to knowing when to take turns speaking ().
In open–domain conversation
like the one a convform chatbot holds with experiment participants,
the main challenge is to recognize
when there is a topic at hand
that interests the participant.
Another discipline in the realm of ending the conversation
is recognizing it is a good time to end the conversation
due to the participants lack of interest.
Conversation designs made for this paper
do not take much of this into account.
The main goal for a convform chatbot here
is to present the participant with a stimuli.
Once they manage that,
if the participant is willing to continue
the conversation continues for a hardcoded number of responses.
This leads to participants sometimes noticing
the conversation ending abruptly
and mentioning they would like to continue
in the questionnare
or even at the very end of the conversation itself.
This can potentially have effect on
the score given by the participant
and therefore brings noise into this parameter.
In terms of quantization
conversation is inherently noisy.
Since each conversation has to be manually checked,
an assessment of how to deal with this noise can be made
while and after processing the data.
A runtime topic annotation
and other prompting techniques
could potentially help make
the convform chatbot converse in such a way
that would be more aware of the general course of the conversation
perhaps giving hints about ending the conversation ahead of time
or reacting to and handling the participants hints of the same type.

\chapter{Data}

The data collected using a convform chatbot
is a transcript of the conversation
between a participant and the chatbot.
Depending on the conversation design of the given chatbot
the conversation may contain a record of
the participant being exposed to a specific situation
and their reaction to it.
Other than that the collected data contains
an information about whether the participant quit the conversation,
the participants rating of the conversation
and their comment on it.

Unfortunately it cannot be guaranteed
the required stimuli actually occurs in the conversation.
Though the probability is relatively high,
the LLM technology responsible for most answers
is nondeterministic
and the participants tend to be unpredicatble.
On many levels conversation can take an unintended direction
which can spoil the stimuli.
Whether thematic, textual or interactional,
anything can go wrong.
That is why as mentioned earlier,
each conversation needs to be visited manually
to confirm required stimuli is present.
That does not present too much of a problem
since a qualitative analysis of the data
has the potential to bring lots of
corrections to experiment design,
relevant observations or
inspiration for further steps.
It would however pose a complication
was one interested in scaling up this approach
that would have to be dealt with.

\chapter{Final thoughts}

\section{Evaluation of anaphora categorization}

    The categorization used in this research has been simplified for exploration.
    The immediate observation has been that both deep and nonassignable anaphora
    have two dominant participant reactions.
    The deep anaphora was had a similar number of acceptance and metacommunicative reaction.
    This begs a question whether it is possible to program and prompt two different chatbots,
    that will be capable of sharing these two types of reactions.
    In other words the question is whether it is possible to simulate an immediately acceptable
    and a confusing deep anaphora.
    The same goes for the nonassignable anaphora
    where the split was on the metacommunication and abroting the conversation.
    Here the task to split these two types up among two different chatbots is even trickier,
    because the criteria of not understanding and directly ending the conversation might depend on
    individual circumstances.
    That way the textual aspect of the conversation would have a lesser effect.

    That qualitative analysis shows also that
    at least one disruptive anaphora type has been elided from the categorization.
    In many cases the participant confusion stemmed from the ambivalence of the anaphora -
    there has been multiple mapping candidates.
    There is a hint of a more granular categorization of disruptive anaphora.

    Finally on anaphora and conversation coherence in general,
    it is not easy to just break the anaphora,
    something always comes along with it as the various factors at hand in conversation are intertwined.
    The data certainly showed, that everytime there is a anaphora related coherence disruption in conversation,
    this impacts the topical structure of the unfolding text of conversation
    which is where the incoherence ends up being perceived.

\section{Further steps}


    \subsection{Experiment design improvement}

        For future research better control over the conversation needs to be gained.
        That way the amount of noise can be decreased as there would be less sources
        of confusion or nonacceptability in the conversation text other than the stimulus.
        Participants could also be exposed to a sequence of conversations with different stimulus each time.
        That way the stimuli could be ordered a certain way and a rating development metric would be gained.
        Lastly more granular approach to the participant reaction to stimulus could be taken.
        At least one type has been ommited or rather fused with the metacommunication reaction type -
        the late aborting of the conversation.
        After the stimulus if the participant reacts in a metacommunicative way,
        the chatbot has a chance to fix the disruption.
        If it does not succeed in that, the coherence remains disrupted and
        the social interaction illusion falls due to the stimulus but not directly after the stimulus.
        For this the chatbot also needs to have access to which entity the anaphora has been referring to.

    \subsection{Stimulus generation improvement}

        Some of the challenges met during the course of the research have to do with
        the stimulus generation.
        One improvement that has been mentioned above is the chatbot being aware of what it is referring to
        with its anaphoras.
        In this version of convform, this information has not been stored anywhere.
        It should be present in the prompt in case the participant is confused and asking about it.
        The secondary reaction might show which types of referents will be acceptable or less so.

        The conversation quality needs to improve.
        The zero anaphora has to be deployed where it is appropriate to decrease the nonacceptability noise.
        Better topic progression awareness needs to be developed in convform.
        The chatbot sometimes ignores questions and asks its own which is topically and sequentially inappropriate.

        Lastly the nonassignable anaphora stimulus could be improved to generate stimulus responses via prompt.
        That would require generating an irrelevant entity and anaphorically referring to it.
        This challenge could provide more insight on associativity and pseudoanaphora if tackled succesfully.

    \subsection{Hybrid approach}

            All of the aforementioned improvements are hard to achieve with the current state of convform.
            At the time of this research it functions as a hybrid tree structure where the response is either
            hardcoded or a prompt.
            To gain more flexibility, the dialog management needs to be more prompt oriented.
            However to keep the control, the prompt needs to consist of components that self regulate based on
            logic and analysis prompts.
            Essentially with each turn metadata
            like topical and sequential status of the conversation should be collected.
            The components should then be allowed to assemble the prompt
            based on this data while following the conversation designer instruction.
            This process should allow for creating a dialog system that is aware of what is going on
            and can conditionally produces prompts and generate responses
            that are defined by the conversation designer
            while maintaining the flexibility with which state-of-the-art systems interact.

\section{New opportunities}

With a dialog system of this nature
intentionally creating the stimuli hinted at in the analysis would become possible:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item{Understanding the bimodality of deep and nonassignable anaphora}
    \item{Deep anaphora referring to a (non)topicalized entity}
    \item{Closer look at zero reference, pseudoanaphora and associativity}
    \item{Observing participant reactions to nonfactual implications}
    \item{Comparing different anaphora depths}
    \item{Topic shift with or without discourse markers}
    \item{Secondary participant reactions to repair attempts}
    \end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

The methodology used in present research has be experimental on two levels.
One was to see whether it can be useful for conversation research.
While there are many improvements to be made on both the experimental framework
and the stimuli, it has proven to be able to generate data that would be otherwise
impossible to get.
This comes at the price of annotation. Every conversation has to be visited to confirm
whether the required stimulus is actually present.
With improving conversation design, this might become a smaller issue
and with a certain degree of precision and a certain scale,
annotations might become obsolete.
For now and near future, the conversations will be visited.
Seeing the interactions with ones own eyes has been the goal of the research regardless,
so annotating can also be perceived as a reward rather than a price.

The other level was to expose participants to a chatbot that would subvert the course of the conversation.
This has shown to be succesful to a decent degree although here also it a lot of improvement to be made
nn both practical and theoretical aspect.
The result itself has been more or less unsurprising and the experiment served mainly to generate data
that would support this uncontroversial claim.
From here, multiple research paths can be taken in both understanding the inner workings of conversation
and attempting to simulate various situations using the dialog system.
