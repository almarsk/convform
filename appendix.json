      "prompt": "What is an entity? A person, a thing; may not be animate. It is always a noun, and most nouns are entities in speech. Look out! Pronouns such as 'you', 'he', and the like are never entities, even if they represent persons. Verbs are certainly by no means entities, even if they represent a person. Nouns that are not entities in speech are very generic or temporal. A subject in a sentence to which reference may be made by a personal or reference pronoun. The utterance usually has one entity, sometimes two, and rarely more. Often, the utterance lacks an entity altogether. The participants in the conversation are never entities in any way. Example: 'Alice likes speedball the best.' The entities in this sentence are ['Alice', 'speedball']. Example: 'We're meeting tomorrow at 2:00.' This discourse lacks an entity, so the output is []. Example: 'What do you like?' This discourse lacks an entity, although there is a personal pronoun in it, so the output is []. Example: 'How are you, Carl?' This speech lacks an entity, because the communicator is never an entity, so the output is []. Example: 'I just hope it doesn't get too cold.' This speech lacks an entity, because atmospheric phenomena are never entities, so the output is []. Consider which words are entities in the next sentence: [user input]. Consider the meaning of each noun in a sentence and whether it could represent a specific entity and not just an abstract concept. Consider all possible objects mentioned in the speech and whether their names could be considered entities. Remember that verbs and pronouns are not entities, even if they represent persons. Remember that the conversationalists are not entities."

      "prompt": "Find one main word in a sentence and swap it for a personal or reference pronoun. Leave the other topic centers as they are. Don't forget to omit words that may be part of the name phrase of the replaced word. Don't forget that when a noun is replaced by a pronoun, you often need to change the verb sequence – the verb will then often be at the end of the sentence; the order of the pronouns must be followed – the replacement pronoun will come before the reversible and the personal pronoun. You also need to correctly recognize the more important word – choose the one about which the question is. To preserve naturalness, you sometimes need to modify a sentence to include a secondary sentence, especially if the replaced word is linked to a deverbative noun. Example 1: Sentence: 'And what will your paper be about?' Consideration: The replaced word will be 'paper.' The word 'your' belongs to the name phrase of the replaced word. Your answer: 'And what will it be about?' Example 2: Sentence: 'How far from your house is your favorite park?' Consideration: The substituted word will be 'park,' as it is more important in the sentence than 'house.' The words 'your' and 'favorite' belong to the name phrase of the substituted word. Your answer: 'How far from your house is it?' Example 3: Context: 'I'll go to the cafe.' Sentence: 'What is your drink in the cafe?' Reasoning: The substituted word will be 'cafe' because it is in context. Due to natural word sequence, you will need to move the substitution pronoun. Your answer: 'What is your drink there?' Example 4: Sentence: 'Do you have any tricks for ironing shirts quickly and efficiently?' Reasoning: The substituted word will be 'shirts,' and because the sentence is complex and the verb cannot be easily moved, a secondary sentence will solve it. Your answer: 'Do you have any tricks for ironing them quickly and efficiently?' Example 5: Sentence: 'What track do you most enjoy racing on?' Your answer: 'Which one do you most enjoy racing on?'"
