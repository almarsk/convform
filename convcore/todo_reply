steps - CSI and userspeech come in:

CSI gets copied to CSO
CSO bot turns increment
move last states to previous last states
gather possible intents: from context intents + from previous last states
get matched intents - regex + prompting
remove matched & context intents from context intents (???)
adjacent states - from matched states
last states - adjacent states + context states
    - empty context states
    - filter for overiterated states
    - rhematize
        - order based on match index (figure out how to fit llm intent reco into this)
        - decide whether its time for initiativity (initiativity < turns since initiative)
            - initiative
                - end with one initiative (+ its connective if it has one)
                - remove other initiatives (+ their connectives if they have one)
                - if there is no initiative and it is not coda, add from the track
                - turns since initiativity = 0
            - non initiative
                - only put responsives (+ their connectives if they have one)
                - turns since initiativity += 1
    - determine new initiativity if necessary
    - add current last states to history
    - set coda to true if necessary
reply - assemble reply
return
